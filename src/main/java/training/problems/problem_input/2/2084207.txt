Reason For Visit: Pre-op
History of Present Illness:
He is here with his wife. This is a pre-op visit. He is anticipating hernia repair next week. He has been feeling well. Stable dyspnea on exertion. He is able to climb two flights of stairs without stopping. He would get appropriately fatigued with this. He has no peripheral edema. No palpitations. EKG today shows afib with V- paced complexes. I reviewed lab work from 4/2019 showing stable renal function and electrolytes. CBC also with stable anemia. Patient denies any blood in the stool or melena.

The moderate loculated left pleural effusion is also again seen and essentially unchanged.
The previously seen ground-glass opacities in the right lung base has cleared.
The previously seen mediastinal lymphadenopathy is again identified and essentially unchanged.
There is extensive coronary calcifications identified.
No CHF or pneumonia is identified.
Impression
5 mm right middle lobe pulmonary nodule, unchanged since the previous study of 01/12/2015. A further follow up noncontrast
low-dose chest CT scan in 6-12 months is recommended.
Moderate left loculated pleural effusion, unchanged.

DESCRIPTION OF CARDIAC STRUCTURES
Rhythm: Paced Rhythm
Left Ventricle: Left ventricle is nondilated. Ventricle septal motion is hypokinetic related to right ventricular pacing as well as previous open-heart surgery. Overall left ventricular ejection fraction is low normal to mildly reduced and estimated to 50-55%. Mild left ventricular hypertrophy is present
LV Wall Motion:
Ejection Fraction : Estimated 50-55%
Right Ventricle : Right ventricle was normal. Right ventricle is nondilated. Pacemaker lead is noted
IVC: IVC was normal.
Right Atrium: Right atrium is dilated. Pacemaker lead is noted
Left Atrium: Left atrium is dilated
Atrial Septum: Atrial septum was normal.
Mitral Valve: Mitral valve was normal.
Aortic Valve: Status post bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement. Leaflet motion is preserved
Tricuspid Valve: Tricuspid valve was normal.
Pulmonic Valve: Not well scen
Pericardia Effusion: No pericardial effusion seen.
Ascending Aorta: No abnormalities seen
Aortic Arch: No abnormalities seen.
Echo Doppler: Doppler study shows mild mitral regurgitation and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is 42 mmHg.
Doppler probe through the prosthetic aortic val ved a peak velocity of 1.2 m/s giving a peak transvalvular gradient of 6 with a mean gradient of 3 mmHg
IMPRESSIONS
Comments:
Conclusions:
#1. Nondilated left ventricle with septal hypokinesis related to previous cardiac surgery and/or right ventricular pacing and low normal to mildly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction
#2.. Mild left ventricular hypertrophy
#3. Pacemaker lead in the right heart

Chief Complaint
 GI bleeding
History Of Present Illness
This is a 80-year-old gentleman who is here this afternoon at the request of his primary care provider. He is being seen after recent hospitalization in Florida, here with his spouse who helps provide his history.
He apparently was admitted with anemia/melena and GI bleed. A EGD was preformed which revealed fresh blood from an oozing gastric AVM's which were treated with APC. His anticoagulation (Pradaxa) was discontinued. He did require some FFP prior to his procedure to help reverse his INR. Of note there was concern for possible Barrett's but no biopsies were taken. He was reportedly placed on BID Protonix and discharged with a HGB of 8.4. Per his wife he did receive a unit of blood. He has a follow up with Dr. Franklin on Monday to review the need for anticoagulation moving forward. Was placed on anticoagulation about 2 years for ? AFIB and TIA.
Stooling daily since discharge, stools now brown. NO reports of stomach discomfort.
Last colonoscopy 8 years with Dr. Nichelle was w/o polyps. NO plan for a f/u colon.

Assessment
81-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer currently on Lupron. His PSA has been slowly rising over the last year and he now has new complaints of bone pain in the left hip. I have asked him to obtain an updated bone scan since the last one was in 2016. Additionally, we talked about moving on to additional treatment. He is a candidate for Provenge. I will ask my office to determine what the out of pocket cost would be. If this is too expensive, will consider referral to medical oncology for consideration of second line hormonal management.
