Chief complaint
 Varicose veins of lower extremities
 Edema
History of present illness
Gail Miller is an 83 year old female.
Dear Dr. Ridge, It was a pleasure meeting Ms. Gail Miller today during her initial office visit for symptomatic bilateral lower extremity edema and leg heaviness. As you recall, Ms. Miller is a delightful 83-year-old retired jewelry retailer associate who reports medical history including hypothyroidism and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma diagnosed and treated approximately 9 years ago. Her primary complaint today is bilateral lower extremity edema and significant leg heaviness and fatigue, worse in the right leg. She states that the leg heaviness is present throughout the day, including when she awakens, causing her to have difficulty walking up even a few stairs. Lower extremity edema, which is also worse in the right leg, is progressive over the course today, as is a bright red 'stripe' that runs from her medial right knee down to the medial ankle. She has varicose veins in bilateral lower extremities, but denies any episodes of superficial thrombophlebitis, or any pain throughout the day. She receives acupuncture treatments which have been helping with the numbness of her feet.
Ms. Miller denies any history of frank hemorrhage, ulceration, or impaired wound healing of the lower extremities. She has worn compression stockings for several years to reduce her lower extremity edema during long car trips or when she is sitting for prolonged periods of time, such as going to the movies. However, her symptoms return as soon as the the stockings are removed. Her baseline exercise capacity was poor, and she develops shortness of breath with limited ambulation. I estimate her NYHA functional class is III+.

Plan
Ms. Gail Miller is a delightful 83-year-old retired jewelry retail associate who presents for discussion of lower extremity ultrasound results, and for discussion of therapeutic options for bilateral lower extremity complaints as described above. Ultrasound from 07/26/2018 documented absence of DVT bilaterally. There were venous insufficiency and reflux throughout bilateral GSVs including the saphenofemoral junctions. Bilateral AAGSVs of the thighs were dilated with venous insufficiency and reflux. Bilateral SSVs were within normal limits. The GSVs were not particularly dilated beyond the saphenofemoral junctions, which was unexpected, given the severity of her stasis dermatitis, particularly on the right leg.
We had a long discussion regarding the pathophysiology of venous insufficiency and reflux, and how they may be contributing to the patient's symptoms. I explained the nature of the recommended endovenous ablation procedure. I explained that the risks would likely be elevated given her advanced age, and that I wished to evaluate other etiologies of her lower extremity edema as well as assessing whether she could ambulate sufficiently post-procedure (to reduce the risk of post-procedure DVT and possible pulmonary embolism), before recommending ablation therapy.
The benefits of ablation therapy were explained to the patient, with the understanding that improvement in symptoms is expected, but cannot be guaranteed. Alternatives to the recommended procedures were discussed, as well as the consequences of refusal to proceed with the recommended treatment plan, which generally include worsening of any current symptoms, and possible progression to severe venous insufficiency with potential complications including pain, edema, venous stasis ulceration, infection, and hemorrhage. The patient was provided the opportunity to ask questions about the ultrasound imaging, clinical diagnosis, and proposed treatment plan.
The patient understands that the risks of endovenous catheter ablation include, but are not limited to: pain and bruising, bleeding, infection, deep vein thrombosis (generally 0.1% to 0.01% incidence), pulmonary embolism, peripheral neuropathy/paresthesias (typically temporary, with 25-30% incidence), and the possibility of recanalization of the target vein(s). The risk of major, life-threatening complications is estimated at less than 0.1%. The likelihood of successful vein closure via catheter ablation is typically >97% for axial saphenous veins and approximately 60% for perforator veins, after a single procedure. The patient verbalized understanding of the risks and benefits of endovenous ablation.
RECOMMENDATIONS/PLAN:
1. Prescriptions provided for 20-30mmHg knee-high and 30-40mmHg thigh-high compression stockings as ongoing conservative treatment for venous insufficiency, and post-treatment use, respectively. The patient should not wear compression stockings within 48hrs of any scheduled ablation procedure or sclerotherapy, or any diagnostic ultrasound.
2. Follow-up visit in 4 weeks to assess response to conservative treatments and also to assess her ability to ambulate sufficiently, as I asked the patient to see if she could increase her daily activity to 4 walking sessions daily, 20 minutes each. I suspect that she will not be able to tolerate this level of physical activity.
3. I will be contacting the patient's PCP, Dr. Shane Ridge, to see if he has any recent assessment of her renal function, as well as a recent echocardiogram to assess for both systolic and diastolic dysfunction, to rule out other etiologies of her lower extremity edema. Given her complaints of shortness of breath with limited physical activity, a cardiac stress test may not be unreasonable.
4. I will reassess the patient's physical activity tolerance, her response to compression stocking therapy, and review any recent echocardiogram and blood work at a follow-up visit in 4 weeks. She is willing to consider proceeding with endovenous ablation if the risks are not prohibitive, and I agree that this is an appropriate approach. Based on her limited functional status at this time, I would not feel comfortable proceeding with ablation therapy due to the elevated risk of DVT and pulmonary embolism.
Total encounter time was 45 minutes, of which more than half were spent in direct, face-to-face contact with patient providing education, counseling, and discussing the risks and benefits of any recommended procedures, and obtaining informed consent.

Clinical Impression
It has now been >10 years since Mrs. Miller was diagnosed with an extranodal marginal zone B-cell MALT lymphoma of the stomach.
At today's visit, I believe she remains in complete clinical remission. She does not have any symptoms or physical exam findings to suggest recurrence of her lymphoma. She had a recent CBC, complete metabolic profile, and LDH, none of which have significant abnormalities.
Gail has also had iron deficiency anemia. Ferritin improved to >100 despite being off of oral iron. Therefore, I will plan to repeat her iron panel with her next blood draw in one year.
Based on the favorable findings, she will just return in 12 months per her request with blood work. She may decline future CT scans.
She has decided to defer endoscopy as well. She understands the nature of her lymphoma and the possibility of late recurrence both in the stomach as well as systemically. She expresses understanding of this but wishes to defer testing unless she is symptomatic based on her age.

History of Present Illness
General HPI:
1. Hx of GIST tumor 2009. In remission. Actively followed by Dr. Mariano. Last seen May, 2017. Next OV planned for 4/2018. Will consider next EGD in 2019 and next CT in at future visit with heme/onc. Lab tests are planned prior to that OV: CBC, CMP, LDH, iron panel, ferritin prior to next visit. Patient continues on ferrous sulfate 325mg po daily.
2. Peripheral neuropathy affecting feet. Secondary to cancer treatment. EMG 2013. She is 'used to it'
3. Hypothyroid, aquired. Euthyroid. Last TSH October, 2016. Has been in the normal range since 2008.
4. Situational anxiety with periodic insomnia. Uses PRN alprazolam. Is quite well controlled.
5. c/o peripheral (bilateral) LE swelling. Hx of prior vein stripping.
She does not think she would want to go through a vascular evaluation or procedure. She'd rather 'live w it for now'. Meantime, does not consume much salt. Swelling does improve with LE elevation.

Feels an 84-year-old female status post excision of a GI tract just tumor about 10 years now. She is doing well. She is frustrated by decreasing physical ability to 'do what she wants '. She cites mostly a numbness in her feet. I am most suspicious of a polyneuropathy attributable to Rituxan. According the Lexicomp approximately 30% of users and up with a neuropathy.She also has vericose veins with venous stagnation without stasis dermatitis or phlebitis. Her skin is soft and intact and nontender. I don't think vein treatment would likely restore much function or prevent skin damage. She is welcome to another opinion from vascular. She will let me know.
Treatment
1. Hypothyroidism, unspecified type
Continue Levothyroxine Sodium Tablet, 50 MCG, 1 tablet every morning on an empty stomach, Orally, Once a day
2. PVD (peripheral vascular disease)
Notes: discussed going back to vascular surgery, which she is not interested in now, could do it any time. Meantime, she'll continue to minimize her salt intake, keep her legs elevated, which tries to skin and can consider compression stockings on top of that.
3. Anxiety
Continue Alprazolam Tablet, 0.5 MG, 1 tablet, Orally, once a day as needed for anxiety
Follow Up
