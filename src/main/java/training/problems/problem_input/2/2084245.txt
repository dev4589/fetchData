Dear Dr. Petruzziello:
I had the privilege of providing care to Ernest Tuscano on 5/17/2016. Attached is my note from the visit.
Yale Medical Group - Cardiology Outpatient Consultation Note
Primary Care Physician: Patruzziello, Fausto MD
Patient Name: Emest Tuscano
DOB: 11/28/1934
MRN: MR2438089
Age: 81 y.o.
Consult Summary
Mr. Ernest Tuscano is a 81 y.o. (DOB: 11/28/1934) male who is referred today for evaluation of CAD prior to right total hip replacement. Last seen over 4 years ago and lost to follow up. Has had progressive OA of right hip and knee. Scheduled to undergo one or both replacements. Unable to assess functional status as he is too limited by his OA - he 'just sits in a rocking chair all day long'.
CAD s/p DES to CFX in 2003. Last stress test 2012 which was negative for ischemia..
Impression: Given numerous risk factors and inability to assess perfomance/functional status, we should risk stratify him with a pham MPI prior to upcoming major surgery
Recommendations/Plans:
1) resume ASA 81 mg qd
2) HLD: LDL < 90 on high dose simva - > will change to atorva
3) BP at goal
Patient
Type 2 diabetes mellitus with complication
Essential hypertension
