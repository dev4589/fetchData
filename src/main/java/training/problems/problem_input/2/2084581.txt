Encounter Diagnoses
Name
Primary?
Vulvar dysplasia
VAIN (vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia)
Yes
INTERIM HISTORY: The patient returned to the Yale Gynecologic Oncology Center on May 18, 2018, for a followup of her vaginal and vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia. The patient has a long history of having low-grade surface epithelial changes as well as CIN 3 that date back to the time of hysterectomy in 1976, when she had cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in addition to fibroids. In 1980s, she had multiple vulvar excisions including for condylomata and seborrhea keratosis. In 1990, she had excision of VIN 1. In 2006, she had an excision of VIN 3. Again, in 2006, she had a re-excision of that lesion xtensive laser vaporization of the vulva and perianal area. In November 2007, she underwent an extensive laser vaporization of the vulva and the entire perianal area. Since that time, the patient has had intermittent low-grade Pap smears from the vulvar and/or vagina. The patient's most recent Pap smear of the vulva was unsatisfactory due to insufficient cellularity.
However, the Pap smear of the vagina revealed a low-grade squamous lesion. The patient returns today without complaints. She has no itching or burning. She has no vaginal discharge. She has no bleeding. The patient is up to date with mammograms and with colonoscopy.

APPEARANCE: The patient is underweight.
EYES: Conjunctivae and lids were normal. Pupils and irises were equal, round and reactive to light.
EARS/NOSE/MOUTH/THROAT: Oropharynx mucosa without erythema, discharge or blisters.
NECK: Supple. No evidence of thyromegaly.
CHEST: Normal respiratory effort.
CARDIOVASCULAR: Femoral and para-aortic pulses present and equal. No lower extremity varicosities were noted. No peripheral edema noted.
BREASTS: Breast examination was deferred.
ABDOMEN: Abdomen was soft, non-tender with no masses, hepatosplenomegaly or hernias. There was no
CVA tenderness. The bowel sounds were normal. An old well-healed Pfannenstiel incision was present.
PELVIC EXAM: Inspection of the vulva revealed a punctate, hyperpigmented change at the base of the left labia minora. There were extensive changes in the vulva consistent with extensive laser vaporization and scarring. There were no obvious lesions that appeared pre-malignant. The urethra and bladder were within normal limits. The uterus, cervix, and adnexa were surgically absent. Rectovaginal and bimanual examinations were confirmatory.
LYMPHATICS: Lymph node survey including the supraclavicular, axillary, and inguinal nodes was negative.
MUSCULOSKELETAL: The upper and lower extremities had full rangeof movement and had equal muscle strength.
SKIN: No rashes, lesions, or subcutaneous nodules noted.
NEUROLOGIC: Cranial nerves were intact.
MENTAL STATUS: Oriented to person, place, time. Affect was appropriate.
ASSESSMENT/PLAN: My impression is the patient clinically is free of disease. We have discussed again the finding of low-grade squamous intraepithelial change. The patient has this as a chronic condition. I have told her that should the Pap smear read more than just a low-grade change, she is to return and undergo colposcopy and biopsy if necessary. Otherwise, the patient will return in 6 months for routine followup. The patient will call in 2 weeks for the results of the Pap smears.
