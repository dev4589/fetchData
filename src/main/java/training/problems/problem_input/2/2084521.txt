RE: Nicholas G Maravell
D.O.B.: 06/02/1944
Dear Timothy A. Tobin M.D.
Nicholas G Maravell was seen in my office on 04/24/2019 for cardiovascular evaluation.
Cardiovascular History
Nicholas Maravell is a 74 year old male.
He returns for follow-up. He has been pretty compliant with Eliquis, and he does not think he has had any missed doses but he cannot be 100% sure. Ile has not been back to see Dr. R yet. I le does not have sleep apnea. The nuclear perfusion scan did not show any evidence for myocardial ischemia. He did have coronary calcification. He has had to go to the ER a couple of times for bleeding varices. He does not report other bleeding. He has shortness of breath, sometimes worse than others. He still eats out a lot and he has not lost weight. No chest pain discomfort. No fainting, near fainting, and he would like to proceed with cardioversion. Recent echo showed moderate LVH, and moderate aortic stenosis.
O
No chest pain or discomfort No palpitations
Dyspnea
Soft tissue swelling
 No dizziness No lightheadedness No fainting
Past Medical History
-
1. Prostatism
2. Asthma
3. Eczema
4. Hypertension
5. Obesity, morbid
6. History of urinary tract infection
7. History of heart failure, not otherwise ecified.

 Clinical summary provided to patient.
This is a 74-year-old man with many, many comorbidities. Please see below.
1. Heart failure, mildly reduced LVEF. Reticent to use beta blocker because of 'bad' asthma. May need to consider in the future. For now, we'll try to improve LVEF with DC cardioversion. I told him that with his comorbidities the chance of long-term success is low, however, he still would like to proceed with the procedure, because he felt better with sinus rhythm and because the procedure helped in the past.
We'll then reassess LVEF afterwards. If remains low-normal to mildly reduced, consider the addition of ACEi or ARB. Class wants to concentrate on the cardioversion at this time. Continue Inspra. He is no longer on bumetanide but instead torsemide as it was changed by Dr. R. I still think that he may benefit from infusion, given the massive edema. Calorie restriction and low sodium use reemphasized again.
Plan for DC cardioversion 3 weeks for now as long as he does not miss any doses of Eliquis. He will call
Dr. Radojevich too.
2. Atrial fibrillation, moderate in severity. Continue to monitor. Repeat echo in 6-12 months.
3. Given that he did have coronary calcium identified, even though no myocardial ischemia, and normal lipids in the past, if he is willing would consider a statin in the future. Again, he wants to focus on one thing at a time right now.
 Chronic diastolic (congestive) heart failure
Lab: BMP, ALT, AST, Fasting Lipid Panel. CK

Hospital Course
75-year-old man who lives at home, history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on oral anticoagulation, diastolic congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, asthma, obstructive uropathy secondary to enlarged prostate who px on 5/20 with lower extremity cellulitis and shortness of breath. He was found to have severe bilateral hydronephrosis, requiring bilateral nephrostomy tube placement. He

-------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------
was also treated for cellulitis and has finished a course of antibiotic therapy. He had a hemodialysis catheter placed for incipient hemodialysis for worsening kidney function, but this has stabilized and he never required HD so this was ultimately removed. He was also on prednisone for a rash until
June 9. During his course he has gotten progressively weak and is barely eating.
During his course he continued to have SOB and hypoxemia. Updated CT on June 13 showed right base infiltrate. There was concern for aspiration by speech therapy. Before he could be further assessed, he developed worsening respiratory failure. He was transferred to IMCU but failed BIPAP and wasultimately intubated.
After intubation he had copious secretions and was treated for an aspiration pneumonia. All cx remained negative. He was treated for rapid atrial fibrillation. Because he was intubated and sedated, he was ultimately kept in bed with his legs elevated which significantly improved their erythema and edema. Wound care had been seeing him the whole admission and helping to guide his treatment though he continued to have significant wounds on his feet.
On June 18 he was doing well on CPAP trial with minimal secretions so he was extubated. He was agitated and uncomfortable while on ventilator and even more so after extubation. His significant other Darcy said that even when on medical floor he was anxious and often felt too confined in the bed.
I met with his sister Gloria and girlfirend Darcy on June 18 along with Debby Potticary RN from palliative care. Gloria is an OT and is familiar with chronic medical problems. Darcy has been here the whole hospitalization and sees his decline. She also has been his girlfriend for many years and has lived with him for the past 3 years. We went through his medical history and his reluctance for medical care in the past. I expressed my concerns that I did not think he would recover and may require chronic trach (because of inability to tolerate BIPAP) and if he remained vent dependent, he would have a feeding tube, which Darcy says would be intolerable to him to not be able to eat.
Gloria was quite clear that she felt hospice care was appropriate at this time because it would awful for him to further decline or be back and forth to SNF without any real improvement, which she has seen mutiple times throughout her career. After much discussion, Darcy was in agreement.
Therefore we changed his status to AND and provide comfort measures only. The patient is not cognizant at this time to understand the conversation but they both felt this was in line with his behavior and attitude and that hospice is most appropriate at this time.
He is being discharged to hospice for further maganement.
