RE: Chambers, Muriel
DOB: 08/08/1944
April 23, 2019
Subjective: Muriel Chambers is a 74-year-old pleasant female with a history of Parkinson's disease, right SI joint pain syndrome, right piriformis syndrome, and lumbar radiculopathy. She comes in for her six-month followup visit. The patient reports one episode of fall due to right foot caught on ground resulting in right wrist Colles fracture. The right forearm fracture was fixed by Dr. White about two months ago. It healed well.
The patient complains of increased frequency of freezing around 11:30 a.m. and 7:30 p.m. before the next dose. The patient takes Stalevo 31.25/125/200 four times daily (at 8:00 a.m., 12:00 noon, 4:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m.). The patient needs to go to lunch with friends twice per week.
The patient also currently takes Ropinirole 1 mg t.i.d. and Amantadine 100 mg b.i.d.
Review of Systems (14 points): Some blurred vision, neck pain and stiffness, joint pain, and anxiety.
Physical Examination: Her mentation, language, and cranial nerves are normal. There is mild cogwheel rigidity at her both wrists. There is no obvious hand tremor. Motor: Right foot dorsiflexion weakness 4+15. Gait: Good stride and speed, six steps make a turn.
Impression:
1. Parkinson's disease, slowly progressive worse with occasional freezing before the next dose at noontime or late evening.
2. Right SI joint pain syndrome, stable.
3. Lumbar radiculopathy with right piriformis syndrome, stable.
4. Recent fall resulting in right Colles fracture, surgically fixed and healing well.
Plan: The patient is counseled regarding her symptoms, diagnoses and further management.
The patient is asked to walk with a cane and avoid fall and injury. She should continue current medications; Amantadine, Stalevo, and Ropinirole for her Parkinson's disease management. She is asked to participate in Parkinson's disease related exercise programs such as pseudo boxing, fast cycling on stationary bike and speaking louder. The patient will be followed up in one to two months.
Sincerely Yours, Goug hian
