Dear Dr. Stein:
I saw Claire today follow up of her atrial fibrillation management as well as hypertension management.
As my letters and records reflect, I have been in constant cffort is trying to find the right balance of medications for Claire. There has been essentially no satisfactory medication that has improved licr functional status without some adverse reaction, As a result, the only antihypertensive that she is on is triamterene/HCTZ onc-half pill daily, Clairc says that she is exhausted after her morning chores and she keeps asking why she does not have more energy. I had tried her on medication to put her in sinus rhythm, none of which eflective. If anything, they slowed her down and made her leel wcak.
were
Although she has thyroid issues, she is secing Dr. Diana Wagner who says that right now there is no intervention indicated for her thyroid.
Physical Examination:
Vital Signs: Blood pressure 146/90 in the right arm and 152/90 in the left. These readings are lower than on her previous visit. Pulse was 68 and irregular.
Neck: Neck had no JVD. Carotids 2.
Lungs: Clear
Cardiac Exam: Irregularly irregular. Si and S2. No audible murmurs or gallops.
Extremities: She did have a skin abrasion on her leg, which occurred three weeks ago. It is a dry and showing signs of healing; however, I had told her she probably should have sought medical attention for it.
Impression/Plan: Claire has issues with both hypertension and atrial fibrillation.

Page 2
Impression/Plan: Attempts to return her to sinus rhythm were not tolerated medically, I had her consult with Dr, Eric Crespo. She was not in favor of any intervention such as ablation.
Thoughts of AV nodal ablation did not appear to be indicated, as her heart rates generally do not incrcasc much above the 80s lo 90s.
In regards to hypertension, she has quite labile hypertension and prior significant anxiety. She reports that blood pressures in the morning are elevated, but by the evening, they are in the 110s lo 120s.
As it appears that continuing to reduce Claire's medications has improved her functional capacity and energy, I will take the step of reducing her triamlorenc to just every other day. She will contact me, I she feels noticeably improved, I will take the next step of discontinuing the triamterene altogether. I will then have her follow up on her blood pressure and report back to me.
With best regards
