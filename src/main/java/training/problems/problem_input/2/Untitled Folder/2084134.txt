Dear Timothy Tobin, MD:
Jay Brenneman, was seen today August 16, 2019 regarding Atherosclerosis of native coronary artery of native heart without angina pectoris [125.10].
Patient: Jay J Brenneman
Date of Birth: 3/1/1943
Medical Record Number: 1002537999
Age: 76 y.o. Gender: male
Visit Date: 8/16/2019
Encounter Provider: Subramanian Krishnan, MD
Primary: Timothy Tobin, MD
Assessment & Plan
Discussed:
#1. Coronary artery disease. No active anginal symptoms. Last nuclear stress test demonstrated inferior ischemia. Given his risk factor profile and previous abnormal cardiac catheterization, I recommended repeating a stress test in the near future. He denies any specific symptoms at this time. Encouraged him to continue risk factor modification.
Encouraged him to be more active and try to put in at least 8-10,000 steps a day. He is currently clocking about 4000/day.
#2. Atrial fibrillation. Maintained in sinus rhythm with dofetilide. QT interval normal. Heart rate continues to be on the lower side, but he monitors this routinely during activity and heart rates have been appropriately variable. Hence, I would not make any changes to his

Patient's Name: Jay J Brenneman MRN: 1002537999 D.O.B: 3/1/1943 medicines at this time. We will continue 50 mg of metoprolol, but I would have a low
threshold to drop it if resting heart rate persistently however is under 50.
#3. Hyperlipidemia. On statin. Will obtain blood work before next visit.
Recommendations and Plan:
#1. Stress test in the near future and I will call him with results.
#2. Follow-up in 4 months.
3. Continue current medicines, monitoring heart rate closely.
Subjective
Reason For Visit: A. fib and coronary disease
History of Present Illness:
Complicated 76-year-old man with atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease who is here for follow-up. He feels very well from a cardiac perspective. He denies any chest pain or shortness of breath. No dizziness or lightheadedness. No syncope. No other specific cardiac symptoms. He recently lost his brother-in-law. Also, yesterday was his son's 2-year death anniversary and hence, he is sad today, but otherwise no major cardiac issues.

OCT Macula: Findings RT: Reason for Testing: Assess Response to Surgery, Comparative Data: No Significant
Change Compared to Prior Study. No Preretinal Findings Consistent with an Epiretinal Membrane. Residual RPE
Changes (Central), Loss of IS/OS Layer (Central). Findings LT: Reason for Testing: Monitor Progression, Comparative Data: No Significant Change Compared to Prior Study. Mild Preretinal Findings Consistent with an
Epiretinal Membrane (Juxtafoveal). No Central Irregularity. No Evidence of Macular Edema.
Impression:
Primary: Resolved Recurrent Macular Hole OD (s/p PPV/ERM peeling/gas injection 6/20/17; s/p PPV/ERM-ILM peeling/gas injection 7/3/18). Recurrent Epiretinal Membrane OD (s/p PPV/ERM peeling/gas injection
6/20/17; s/p PPV/ERM-ILM peeling/gas injection 7/3/18). Epiretinal Membrane os. Posterior Vitreous
Detachment OS.
Secondary: PC IOL OU (s/p YAG OS).
Plan:
Discussion: Mr. Brenneman returned for a recheck of both eyes today. He is now 4+ months out from macular hole repair OD. The hole remains closed and there is no new pathology present. The left eye shows a mild
ERM with no pre-hole changes. I expect he will remain stable OU. The acuity limitation OD is related to the photoreceptor layer loss after developing his recurrent hole. No additional retina treatment is indicated. I suggested he resume regular follow up with you. I am happy to see him back should any additional questions or changes arise. Resolved Recurrent Macular Hole OD (s/P PPV/ERM peeling/gas injection 6/20/17; s/p PPV/ERM-ILM peeling/gas injection 7/3/18), Advised to call immediately if any worsening distortion or blurring is noted.
Ocular Meds (Final): Zaditor 0.025% 1 gtt prn.
Follow Up: Dr. King Routine. Dr. Larrison PRN.
Please contact me if I can offer any further information. Thank you again for allowing me to assist in the care of Jay Brenneman.
Sincerely, y

Dear No Recipients:
Jay Brenneman, was seen today May 21, 2019 regarding Essential hypertension [110].
Patient: Jay J Brenneman
Date of Birth: 3/1/1943

Age: 76 y.o. Gender: male
Visit Date: 5/21/2019
Encounter Provider: Subramanian Krishnan, MD
Primary: Timothy Tobin, MD
Assessment & Plan
Assessment
76-year-old with past medical history significant for atrial fibrillation and flutter as well as coronary artery disease who is here for follow-up. At this time, his resting heart rate is low.
He feels reasonably well. However, given heart rate in the 40s, I recommended cutting down the dose of metoprolol to 50 mg once a day. He will continue other medications. I will see him in follow-up in about 6 months. He does have coronary artery disease, but he has no symptoms since restoration of sinus rhythm and hence, we will plan to do a nuclear stress test sometime later this year. I will see him in close follow-up in a couple of months.
He has follow-up with Dr. BHatt in 1 month.
Recommendations and Plan:
