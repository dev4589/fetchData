- no change with nerve appearance or on OCT
Plan: Counseling - Glaucoma suspect.
I counseled the patient regarding the following: monitor annually
Expectations: Glaucoma is usually diagnosed when the following three crlteria are present elevated intraocular pressure, optic nerve damage, and visual field loss. When some of these criteria are missing, it can be challenging to make the diagnosis of glaucoma. Glaucoma suspects have some characteristics of glaucoma, but not all, and the findings may be very subtle. Glaucoma suspects may also include individuals with other risk factors such as a family history of glaucoma, temporary elevations of IOP when taking steroid medications, pseudoexfoliation syndrome, pigmentary dispersion syndrome, thin central corneal thickness, and optic disc hemorrhages.
Contact the office if: Any loss of vision, eye pain, cloudy vision, photophobia, or dark spots or clouds blocking portions of your vision occurs.
2.
Posterior Vitreous Detachment OU
(H43.813)
Plan: F/U for Next Visit Retina.
- 6 week follow up, any change in symptoms call asap - OD
Plan: Counseling - PVD.
I counseled the patient regarding the following:
Eye care: Posterior vitreous detachments usually diminish with time, but it may take several months. They rarely disappear entirely.
Expectations: Posterior vitreous detachments are a normal aging change due to the vitreous jelly pulling away from the retinal lining of the eye.
They may accompany retinal tears, retinal holes, or retinal detachments, 50 a dilated retinal examination is important.
Contact Office it. Posterior vitreous detachments symptoms worsen, Including an increase in number of floaters, you experience flashing lights, loss of vision, or a black curtain blocking your field of vision.
3
Hyperopia OU
{H52.03)
Plan: Refraction.
Manifest Refraction was performed ou.
Indication: Hyperopia OU
Plan: F/U for Next Visit Refractive.
The patient should be scheduled for the following in 12 Months:
- 1 year EE
Plan: Counseling - Hyperopia.
counseled the patient regarding the following:
Eye care: Hyperopia can be treated with corrective eye wear, such as contacts or eyeglasses. Refractive laser surgery approaches include PRK
(photorefractive keratectomy), and LASIK (laser in situ keratomlleusis) and LASEK.
Expectations: Hyperopia or farsightedness is when distant objects can be seen clearly, but close objects do not come into focus. Hyperopia results
If the eyeball is too short, or if there is too little curvature of the cornea.
Contact Office if: Despite corrective therapy, you still have difficult viewing near objects, or develop headache or eye strain.
After counseling the patient, we decided on the following plan for the right eye: Glasses
After counseling the patient, we decided on the following plan for the left eye:
Glasses
4.
Nuclear Cataract os
(H25.12)
Plan: Counseling - Cataracts.
I counseled the patient regarding the following:
Eye Care: Cataracts do not require treatment unless they interfere with vision and impact one's activities of daily living, in which case cataract extraction with lens implant insertion should be performed.
Expectations: Cataracts occur in everyone as they age. Some specific cataracts like posterior subcapsular cataracts occur more commonly in dlabetics, patients taking longterm steroid medications, and following trauma. The appropriate time to perform cataract surgery is when the loss of vision is interfering with your activities of daily living and a change in eyeglass prescription won't help.
Contact the office if: You experience progressive loss of vision, increasing glare, and problems with activities of daily living such as driving, reading, watching TV, seeing street signs, and following the golf ball.

CT THORAX W/CONTRAST: 3/29/2018 8:56 AM
HISTORY: ongoing abnormality seen on CXR R lung
COMPARISON: Study read in conjunction with previous chest x-rays last of which is dated 3/22/2018. Review of previous chest x-rays dating back to
3/23/2017.
TECHNIQUE: Contrast-enhanced CT chest obtained from thoracic inlet to upper abdomen. Axial imaging along with coronal and sagittal reconstructions are reviewed. 100 cc Omnipaque 350 administered intravenously.
Dose reduction techniques performance has been met including automated
exposure control, adjustment of the MA and/or KV according to the patient size and use of the iterative construction technique.
FINDINGS: Thoracic aorta is normal in caliber with no aneurysm, dissection, etc. Pulmonary arterial tree appears normal. No mediastinal or hilar mass lesions demonstrated. No pathologic adenopathy. Heart appears normal in appearance. No pericardial effusion. Mitral valve prosthesis in place.
Utilizing lung window settings, there is curvilinear intraparenchymal density along the anterior segment of the right upper lobe. This abuts the minor fissure with some thickening noted here. These findings may be related to scarring from previous chest tube placement. No focal mass is identified. Remaining lung parenchyma appears intact with some dependent atelectasis right posterior lung base.
No effusion.. Central tracheobronchial tree appears patent.

Utilizing bone window settings, no osseous lesion is identified.
Imaging through the upper abdomen demonstrates postcholecystectomy clips.
Although not optimally evaluated, partially visualized approximately 1.3 cm mass arises from the upper pole left kidney. Density readings are suggestive of a cyst but this area is not optimally evaluated.
IMPRESSION:
CT of the chest demonstrates linear and nodular interstitial changes anterior right upper lobe abutting the minor fissure as noted above. These findings may be sequelae from previous infection, chest tube placement given the previous chest
X-rays, etc. No significant lesion otherwise demonstrated. See above.
