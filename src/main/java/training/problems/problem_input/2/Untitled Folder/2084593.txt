Assessment & Plan
Fred has a type II endoleak likely from an L4 lumbar artery. No surgical intervention is necessary at this time given that the sac size is stable. The literature shows that the majority of type II endoleaks go on to thrombose within 6-12 months from the initial surgery. As long as the aneurysm sac remains stable, this can be observed. He will be undergoing CT scans for cancer surveillance purposes at 3 month intervals. I will review those images to ensure that sac size remains stable. As long as there is no increase in sac size, I will see him back in 6 months.
Subjective
Fred presents today to review the findings on his most recent CTA of the aorta after an ultrasound in our office demonstrated the presence of an endoleak. CT scan confirms the presence of this type II endoleak likely from an L4 lumbar artery but this could not be said with 100% certainty. The aneurysm sac is essentially stable in size. He has had no abdominal pain or flank pain since I last saw him. There have been no changes to his past medical history.

Prior to today's visit, the patient underwent a CTA of the aorta with runoff which demonstrated the infrarenal aortic stent graft which is well opposed to the aortic wall. The aneurysm sac is essentially stable in size. There is increased density focus along the right inferolateral aspect of the aneurysm on the arterial and delayed phase images concerning for a type II endoleak. The feeding artery is not definitively identified but presumably the L4 lumbar artery based on proximity. Patient is also status post cystectomy with urostomy creation. There was no evidence of metastatic disease. There was mild enlargement of the portal vein and prominence of the spleen which could represent portal hypertension in the appropriate clinical setting.

Study Result
EXAMINATION:
CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST
CLINICAL INFORMATION:
Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder.
COMPARISON:
CT abdomen and pelvis 12/04/2018
TECHNIQUE:
Multidetector volumetric imaging was performed from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis following the administration of:
Oral contrast: Given
Intravenous contrast: 80 mL Omnipaque 350
No contrast reaction reported.
Sagittal and coronal reformatted images were obtained on the technologist's workstation.
Total exam dose-length product 1075 mGy-cm.
FINDINGS:
VISUALIZED CHEST: Calcified granulomas in the left lower lobe and posterior right middle lobe are again noted without change. The visualized lung bases are clear. No effusion. The left atrium is prominent.
LIVER, GALLBLADDER, AND BILIARY TREE: The liver is normal in size, shape, and attenuation. No focal hepatic lesion or biliary ductal dilatation is present.
Gallbladder is normally distended. Cholelithiasis. No gallbladder wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid.
PANCREAS: Normal; no mass or surrounding fluid.
SPLEEN: Normal size. No focal lesion.
ADRENAL GLANDS: Normal; no mass.
KIDNEYS AND URETERS: Cortical renal scarring along the anterolateral aspect of the inferior pole left kidney is again noted. Both kidneys enhance symmetrically. Demonstrated cystic lesion in the inferior pole the left kidney measuring up to 0.7 cm, not fully characterized on this exam.
Nonspecific mild bilateral perinephric stranding. Both ureters are prominent, similar to prior exar on and both terminate in the ileal conduit within the right lower quadrant. There was mild urothelial enhancement of the distal right ureter which is no longer noted. No evidence of obstructive uropathy.
Right lower quadrant urostomy.

Heine, Frederick (MR#2002714388) Printed by CRAIG, KRISTIN [3497]
GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT: Stomach and small bowel non-dilated. No colonic wall thickening or pericolonic inflammatory changes. Nonvisualization of the appendix.
ABDOMINAL WALL: Fat-containing right inguinal hernia.
LYMPHOVASCULAR STRUCTURES: No lymphadenopathy. Redemonstrated aortobiiliac stent graft. Redemonstrated aneurysmal dilatation of the distal infrarenal abdominal aorta with aneurysmal sac measuring up to 5.7 cm, similar to prior study. There is a tubular increased density within the aneurysmal sac which is most consistent with a type II endoleak, seen on prior exam. The increased density of the endoleak is likely related to differences in bolus timing.
BLADDER: Bladder has been surgically removed.
PELVIC VISCERA: Prostate gland removal
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No acute or suspicious osseous abnormality. Degenerative changes.
IMPRESSION:
Postoperative changes status post cystectomy and prostatectomy with formation of an ileal conduit within the right lower quadrant. Redemonstrated prominence of the bilateral ureters. No evidence of recurrence or metastatic disease. The previously visualized mild urothelial enhancement within the distal right ureter is no longer noted.
Redemonstrated scarring along the anterolateral aspect of the inferior pole left kidney.
Stable appearing type II endoleak with associated aneurysmal sac in the infrarenal abdominal aorta with associated aortobiiliac stent. The aneurysmal sac measures 5.7 cm, similar to prior exam.

STUDY PERFORMED:
CTA OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST
CLINICAL INFORMATION:
History of EVAR with new endoleak.
History of bladder cancer. Delayed imaging to check for metastatic disease as per urology
DESCRIPTION:
Initial noncontrast localizing scout images and noncontrast CT were obtained.
A timing bolus at the level of the celiac artery was calculated.
Subsequently, arterial, portal venous, and delayed phase multidetector volumetric imaging was performed through the abdomen and pelvis following the administration of 80 mL Omnipaque 350 intravenous contrast.
No contrast reaction reported
The images were reviewed and postprocessed on a dedicated 3-D workstation.
Extensive vascular postprocessing was performed including 3-D volume rendered, maximum intensity projection, and curved multiplanar reformatted images
Total exam dose-length product 2799 mGy-cm
COMPARISON:
Priors including CT abdomen and pelvis dated 05/01/2018.
FINDINGS:
Vascular:
1. Infrarenal Abdominal Aorta: There is an infrarenal aortobiiliac stent in situ. The excluded aneurysm sac just above the bifurcation measures up to approximately 5.8 x 6.2 cm (maximum dimensions in AP X TV), as opposed to 5.7
x 5.9 cm on 05/01/2018 and 5.8 x 5.9 cm on 01/31/2018. The excluded aneurysmal sac demonstrates heterogeneous density on the noncontrast part of the exam. There is increased density focus along the right inferolateral aspect of the aneurysm sac on the arterial and delayed phase images, and maximum intensity between the portal venous and delayed phase images.
2. Mesenteric Arteries: Normal anatomy of the celiac axis, which is patent.
There is mild calcified and noncalcified atherosclerotic plaque at the origin of the superior mesenteric artery without significant stenosis. The inferior mesenteric artery arises from excluded aneurysm sac.
3. Renal Arteries: A single right renal artery arises at the cranial aspect of the infrarenal endovascular stent without evidence of significant stenosis. The main left renal artery, as well as a small inferior accessory

1. Inferior Vena Cava: The inferior vena cava appears patent with normal anatomy.
2. Iliac venous system: Visualized iliac venous system appears patent.
3. Porto-mesenteric venous system: The portal vein measures slightly above the upper limit of normal in size, approximately 1.6 cm.
Nonvascular:
LUNG BASES: No nodules, mass, or focal consolidation. No pleural or pericardial effusion.
LIVER, GALLBLADDER, AND BILIARY TREE: The liver is normal in size, shape, and attenuation. No focal hepatic lesion or biliary ductal dilatation is present.
The gallbladder is physiologically distended with a few small hyperattenuating foci dependently which may represent tiny calculi. No pericholecystic inflammatory change.
PANCREAS: Normal; no mass or surrounding fluid.
SPLEEN: Near the upper limit normal, measuring approximately 13.1 cm in greatest craniocaudal dimension. No focal lesion.
ADRENAL GLANDS: Suspect 5 mm myelolipoma in the right adrenal gland, unchanged from 11/04/2017. No evidence of collision lesion or additional adrenal nodule.
KIDNEYS AND URETERS: There is scarring on the anteroinferior pole of the left kidney with a 1.1 cm simple appearing cyst along the anterior aspect the lower pole. Otherwise, the kidneys are normal in size, shape, and attenuation. No hydronephrosis, hydroureter, or calculi.
GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT: The stomach, duodenum, and small bowel are nondilated. There is an anastomosis in the right upper quadrant. Small amount of stool throughout the colon, decompressed distally. There is an ileal conduit in the right lower quadrant with excreted urinary contrast in the cecum on the delayed phase. The appendix is presumably surgically absent.
ABDOMINAL WALL: Postsurgical changes along the anterior abdominal wall, with right lower quadrant ileal conduit as previously described. There are small bilateral fat-containing inguinal hernias which are similar to the most recent exam.
LYMPHOID STRUCTURES: No lymphadenopathy.
BLADDER: Surgically absent.
PELVIC VISCERA: Unremarkable.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No acute or suspicious osseous abnormality. Mild multilevel degenerative changes in spine, most pronounced at L5-S1.
IMPRESSION:
Infrarenal aortobiiliac stent in situ with evidence of type II endoleak as described above. The feeding artery is not definitively identified but presumably the L4 lumbar artery based on proximity. The excluded aneurysm sac is stable to slightly larger (2-3 mm) when compared with CT dated 01/31/2018.
Status post cystectomy with urostomy creation. No evidence of metastatic disease.
Mild enlargement of the portal vein and prominence of the spleen could

Physical Exam in spite of all the above relatively useless information other than for billing, he was admitted for elective surgical treatment for bladder cancer, following repair of a abdominal aortic aneurysm. His hospitalization was complicated by ST elevation myocardial infarction. He was discharged home has adequate follow-up with urology nephrology cardiology and vascular surgery, see all the referrals made
He is under the care of his wife and himself. He has several drains still in place with no inflammatory response and there is wound in the left abdomen draining clear yellow fluid that appears to be serous fluid. During the visit phone call was made to the ostomy nurse at urology who confirmed that this was serous fluid and the amount was below 300 cc a day and that is why the drain was removed and that was expected.
As noted, his medication changes have been reviewed
Discussed with his wife there is still some emotional issues ago((that are going)) on that he needs to deal with, and he was counseled in that regard.
Since his myocardial infarction he has had no further chest pain, and he is fully ambulatory
His appetite is okay
No breathing issues
He is prepared for self-catheterization next Tuesday at the follow-up with urology

PETER GATES, MD
196 Parkway South, Suite 2013
Waterford, CT 06385
Dear Dr. GATES:
It was a pleasure seeing Mr. Frederick Heine today in my office for a follow-up of cardiomyopathy. As you know, he is a 74 year old man with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 40%), abdominal aortic aneurysm s/p endovascular repair, and bladder cancer s/p cystoprostatectomy. The patient's primary care provider is Dr. Peter Gates.
Mr. Heine was last seen in my office on 6/5/2018. He recently dealt with a gout flare and cellulitis. Right lower extremity edema is improved. He apparently had a normal lower extremity venous ultrasound and x-rays. He denies any chest pain or dyspnea.
He reports some pain from coughing related to a re nt cold. He denies any palpitations, dizziness, or presyncope/syncope. He denies any orthophea or PND. His weight is up 5 lbs from last visit. He is not formally exercising, but stays very physically active at work. Labs from 10/17/2018: Na 145, K+ 3.9, BUN 10, C 0.88, TC 106, TG 103, HDL 40, LOL 47, WBC 5.7, Hb 12.6, Ha
36.8.
Assessment/Plan: In summary, Mr. Heine is a 74-year-old gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction in January 2018, ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 40%), paroxysmal atrial fibrillation not on anticoagulation, abdominal aortic aneurysm status post endovascular repair, bladder cancer status post cystoprostatectomy, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who presents for a routine follow-up visit. On exam, Mr. Heine's blood pressure is normal. The rest of his cardiovascular examination is normal. His ECG shows sinus rhythm, old anteroseptal infarct , and lateral ST-T wave abnormality.
Mr. Heine is well compensated from a heart failure standpoint. He remains physically active without any symptoms or limitations
(NYHA I). He is on appropriate guideline directed heart failure therapy. He should continue aspirin, atorvastatin, carvedilol, and lisinopril. I stressed the importance of a healthy low-salt diet, moderate aerobic exercise ideally for 30 minutes 5 days per week, and weight loss. Mr. Heine knows to contact my office should he develop any cardiac symptoms. Mr. Heine will return to my office in 6 months for follow-up.
Thank you for the opportunity to participate in Mr. Heine's care. Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions.
Sincerely, sta

Discussion/Summary
Mr. Keine is a 74yo gentleman with CKD II (EGFR 68-85, SCr 0.8-1.0) presenting for proteinuria management. His history is notable for HTN, HLD, prior AAA repair, anemia, bladder cancer s/p elective robotic assisted cystectomy
& prostatectomy with extended pelvic lymph node dissection, appendectomy and creation of an Indiana Pouch on 1/22/18 with a post-operative course complicated by AFib with RVR, new findings of anterior STEMI (troponin
>25), ICMP (EF 40% on 1/30/18) and AKI (SCr 2.2). He was last seen on April 27, 2018.
Main complaint today is right foot pain, swelling. Etiology unclear. Initial consideration for gout with minimal improvement in swelling/erythema following colchicine dosing, uric acid also controlled. Secondary consideration for an infection given history of erythema superimposed on area where he had a blister. I advised Mr. Heine that given his recent history of travel and increased activity, an occult fracture and DVT should be ruled out. I recommended he ice his foot, avoid NSAIDs and continue antibiotic course. If any new/different symptoms, he was advised to contact Dr. Gates' office over the weekend or go to an Urgent Care for evaluation.
1. Right Foot Pain, Right Lower extremity swelling
New complaint in October 2018, s/p colchicine dosing with uric acid at goal (<6), currently on Augmentin
- Counseled on avoiding NSAIDs
- Check Right Foot Film to rule out occult fracture
- Check RLE Doppler to rule out DVT
- Cont Augmentin 875mg-125mg BID as written
-
2. Proteinuria
- Renal function stable by creatinine, GFR; decreased proteinuria by July 2018; no urine studies included with October labs
- Check Urine protein/creatinine ratio this month
- Check CMP, UA, Urine Protein/Creatinine Ratio in January 2018
3. HTN:
- Chronic condition, BPs controlled in low-normal range, no symptoms of lightheadedness/dizziness
- Cont Carvedilol 6.25mg BID, Lisinopril 2.5mg daily
4. Vitamin D Deficiency, Hypocalcemia
- Chronic condition, Vit D at goal (>30), PTH previously controlled, Calcium within normal limits
- Cont Vit D3 1000u daily
- Check PTH, Vit D3 in Jan 2018
5. Anemia
- Chronic condition, H/H low but stable, iron saturation not included with July 2018 labs; no Gl symptoms with Iron supplementation
- Cont Ferrous sulfate 325mg daily
- Check Iron Sat, Ferritin to gauge need for continued iron supplementation
6. Hyperglycemia
- Chronic finding, Hga1c within normal range in April 2018, no recent assessment
- Check HgA1C
FIU in April 2019.

Heine, Frederick (MR#2002714388) Printed by CRAIG, KRISTIN [3497]
The heart is normal in size. Coronary artery calcifications are present. No pericardial effusion. No pathologically enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes appreciated on noncontrast imaging of the chest. Thoracic aorta is normal in caliber and demonstrates only mild atherosclerotic disease.
ABDOMEN/PELVIS:
The liver demonstrates normal size, contour and attenuation. No intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The gallbladder is decompressed, limiting evaluation. Punctate densities within the gallbladder potentially represent tiny gallstones or hyperdense bile. The pancreas, spleen and adrenal glands are unremarkable.
The kidneys demonstrate symmetric nephrograms without hydronephrosis. Similar cortical irregularity along the anterolateral lower pole of the left kidney, a stable finding which likely represents scarring from prior infection. A subcentimeter hypodensity of the left kidney is nonspecific but statistically representative of a cyst. There has been interval removal of bilateral ureteral stents. The ureters terminate within an ileal conduit.
Normal caliber loops of small and large bowel. Mild colonic diverticulosis without CT evidence to suggest active diverticulitis. Surgical changes of the ileocecal junction consistent with creation of ileal pouch. The pouch is partially dilated and grossly unremarkable. Air within the pouch is consistent with recent catheterization.
Patient is status post aorto biiliac stent graft. Asymmetric saccular aneurysm is stable measuring 6 cm in maximum dimension. Concentric
hyperdensity is less prominent on todays imaging. Approximately 1.7 cm density inferiorly within the aneurysm sac is suggestive of an endoleak.
Small fat-containing inguinal hernias are again appreciated bilaterally.
Shotty bilateral inguinal lymph nodes again demonstrated. The bladder and prostate gland have been surgically removed.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:
Mild diffuse degenerative changes of the spine.
IMPRESSION:
1. Surgical changes consistent with cystectomy and creation of ileal conduit. There is been interval removal of bilateral ureteral stents. There is no hydronephrosis.
2. 1.7 cm density appreciated inferiorly within the infrarenal saccular aneurysm in this patient who is status post aorto biiliac stent graft. The size aneurysm is stable but this density suggests possible endoleak. This can be further evaluated with dedicated stent graft protocol CTA if clinically indicated.
3. Likely cholelithiasis.

Impression
Duplex examination demonstrates a patent infrarenal abdominal aortic stent graft. The maximum diameter of the residual aneurysm sac measures 5.7cm AP x 6.2 cm TRV. There is evidence of heterogenous matter within the residual
aneurysm sac on gray scale imaging, consistent with mural thrombus. Pulsatile high resistant flow is demonstrated within the residual aneurysm sac, at approximately 7 o'clock position, consistent with an endoleak. The proximal superior mesenteric artery, proximal celiac artery, bilateral proximal renal arteries and the inferior vena cava are all patent. The bilateral stent graft limbs and native iliac arteries, distal to the limbs, are widely patent. There is no evidence of aneurysm in the bilateral common iliac arteries.
Compared with the prior exam dated 1/2018, the endoleak is a new finding.
