Ms. Branciforte is a 86-year-old right-handed Caucasian female with a history of hemorrhagic stroke on February 13, 2011; anxiety, vascular dementia, walking difficulties, hands tremor, vertigo and parasomnia. She had recently a possible viral infection which worsen her underling gait disorder and hands tremor.
The patient is very anxious and frustrated because of underlying situation.
In my opinion she would benefit fomm occupation therapy and physical therapy at home.
She needs OT to evaluate her and advice about tips of drinking fluids from special devices.
She has a great family support but they need guidance.
The patient is very sensitive to medication, which is the reason, I tried in the past for her hands tremor but she had side effects. In the past she was exposed to Primidone, Sinemet for symptomatically improvement of hands tremor, and she developed severe side effects. I will try Botox injections for her hands tremor, I used in the past with good improvement for some patients, and no significant side effects.
This visit accounted for face to face visit for home care agency referral.
