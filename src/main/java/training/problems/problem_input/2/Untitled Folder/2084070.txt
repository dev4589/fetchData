EXAMINATION: MRI ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST
CLINICAL INFORMATION:
81 y.o female h/o cervical cancer and non-specific abdominal pain with elevated LFTs. Liver lesions on CT scan as well.
Please evaluate liver lesions and biliary system.. MRCP as well
COMPARISON:
CT abdomen pelvis and ultrasound of abdomen 01/03/2019
TECHNIQUE:
An MRI scan of the abdomen was performed using multiple imaging sequences and imaging planes. As per the MRCP protocol, heavily T2-weighted 3-D high-resolution MRCP sequences were obtained in the coronal plane along with thin and thick slab coronal images and coronal MIP reconstructions. 9 mL of intravenous Gadavist was given and postcontrast enhanced dynamic evaluation was performed.
FINDINGS:
Liver, Gallbladder, Biliary Tree:
Liver: There are multiple hepatic cysts scattered throughout the liver. These range in size from several millimeters to the largest in the right upper lobe segment 8. This largest cyst is a septated cyst. Measures about 2.7 cm in diameter. There is no solid liver lesions. There are no enhancing masses. There is no intrahepatic bile duct dilatation.
Gallbladder: There is a large gallstone within the gallbladder. This measures at least 7 cm in length. There is no edema around the gallbladder.
Biliary tree: There are 2 small filling defects in the distal common duct consistent with common duct stone. These measure
9 mm and 5 mm. Image 11 series 10. The CBD measures about 5 mm transverse. There is no intrahepatic bile duct dilatation.
Pancreas: The pancreas is atrophic. There is no edema around the pancreas.
Spleen: Normal size and appearance. Splenic vein patent.
Adrenal Glands and Kidneys: Adrenal glands normal. Kidneys bilaterally symmetric in size and function. No focal mass, hydronephrosis, or perinephric stranding.
Bowel Loops: There is a large lateral hernia.
Lymphovascular Structures: Abdominal aorta normal in caliber. No periaortic collections. No abdominal adenopathy or free fluid collection.
Bones: Multilevel degenerative spondylosis of the dorsal spine and lumbar spine.
IMPRESSION:

-------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------
1. Multiple hepatic cysts. No suspicious liver lesions.
2. Large gallstone in the gallbladder. No edema around the gallbladder.
3. There are 2 adjacent CBD stones measuring 9 mm and 5 mm at the distal common bile duct.
4. Large hiatal hernia.
This critical result was discussed with Dr. Munoz on 01/03/2019 10/10 p.m. and it was ascertained that the content and urgency of the report was understood at the time of direct communication.
