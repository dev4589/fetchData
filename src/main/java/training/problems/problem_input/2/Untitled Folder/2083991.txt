2-D/ Color Flow Doppler / Pulse Wave & Continuous Doppler Study
Left Ventricle, Interventricular Septum
Global LV size and systolic function are normal, with basal inferior and inferoseptal hypokinesis. There is mild LVH and mild
LV diastolic dysfunction.
Left Atrium, Interatrial Septum
The LA is normal. The interatrial septum appears structurally normal, without color flow evidence of interatrial shunting.
Mitral Valve
Both mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is trace mitral regurgitation, without prolapse or stenosis.
Aortic Valve/Root
The aortic valve is bicuspid. The leaflets are calcified and have restricted opening. The peak instantaneous and mean aortic valve gradients are 39 and 27 mm of mercury, respectively, with an AVA of 0.9 cm2, consistent with moderate aortic stenosis.
There is no aortic insufficiency or aortic root dilatation.
Right Atrium, Right Ventricle, Tricuspid Valve, Pulmonic Valve
The right atrium and right ventricle are normal in size and systolic function. The tricuspid and pulmonic valves are structurally normal. There is trace tricuspid regurgitation and trace pulmonic insufficiency. There is no pulmonary hypertension.
Pericardium, Extra-cardiac Structures
There is no pericardial effusion, intracardiac mass, thrombus, or vegetation.
Impression:
1. Normal LV size and systolic function, with regional variation, mild LVH, and mild LV diastolic dysfunction. Normal RV size and systolic function.
2. Bicuspid AV with moderate AS.
