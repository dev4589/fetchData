JOHNSON, LEE
MRN#: 1212
10/07/2019
Lee is a pleasant, 80-year-old white male. He has recently developed some gastroenteritis, with hot and cold flashes, nausea and vomiting, a pounding headache, and a flareup of his underlying depression.
He had a CAT scan of his abdomen and pelvis in the ER, and it showed some diverticulosis, without diverticulitis. It showed some renal cysts, but no evidence of any stones or fatty change of his liver, in the absence of a gallbladder. It also showed osteoarthritic changes in his thoracic and lumbosacral back.
He has had an acute frontal headache for 3 days, with nausea and vomiting. He is on Zoloft, but it does not seem to be working. He denies any suicidal ideation. I DC'd the Zoloft, and increased his Effexor from 75 mg to 150 mg, and started him on Vraylar 1.5
mg for 3 days, and then 3 mg a day.
I gave him some Zofran ODT to use 4 mg q. 6 hours p.r.n. for nausea and vomiting. He cannot sleep, and is exhausted. I gave him Xanax to use 1 mg nightly #30.
He is on Protonix. He is tender in his epigastric area. I gave him some Carafate 2 grams b.i.d. for 10 days, and outlined a bland diet.
He appears to have a frontal sinusitis/otitis media on his left side, with red tympanic membranes. Right side is just minimally involved. Throat is non-erythematous.
I gave him 10 days of Cefzil for that at 500 mg b.i.d. I checked an annual PSA. He declined a rectal exam, and denies any prostatic symptoms. I checked liver functions, BUN and creatinine.
I also gave him a B12 shot. He might be developing a little bit of early dementia. I checked B12 levels on him.
He has rheumatoid arthritis, on Arava, with DJD of his knees and vitamin D deficiency. He has chronic allergic rhinitis, not currently being treated.
He is a noninsulin dependent diabetic, well-controlled, with an
A1c of 6.1 in August.

He has peripheral neuropathy, on gabapentin, with unchanged funduscopic, foot, neurological, liver, HEENT, and thyroid exams.
The only change is dehydration, with dry mucous membranes. I stressed to him the importance of adequate hydration. Skin turgor was good. He has no suprapubic or CVA tenderness.
He does have polymyalgia rheumatica symptoms, with hypertension, well-controlled. He has BPH, and low grade chronic renal failure, with pernicious anemia, chronic gastritis, and diverticulosis.
We will see him in 3 weeks, and see how he does. We will continue his Singulair, and see how he does with the new medications.
Weight is 170.8, down 6 pounds, at 5 feet 8 inches. Blood pressure is 110/82. Pulse 66 and regular. He is afebrile. 02 sats are 98% on room air.

JOHNSON, LEE
MRN#: 2212
08/27/2019
Lee is here with anxiety and depression, which are stable. He is an elderly white male. He has rheumatoid arthritis and DJD of his knees and ankles. He has crepitation and tenderness, bilaterally.
He has peripheral vascular disease, with slightly diminished pulses, but no evidence of any DVT. He has chronic allergic rhinitis, with boggy, nontender frontal sinuses. He is vitamin D deficient, with metabolic syndrome.
He has BPH, which is asymptomatic. He declined a rectal exam. He had an infected right second digit last visit. It appears now that he had a foreign object in his finger. With Lee's permission I removed a splinter.
He is a noninsulin dependent diabetic, with peripheral neuropathy. He has chronic renal failure. BUN was 26, and creatinine was 1.19. Last visit it was 1.11. His AlC was 6.4 in March and 6.1 in August, so that is improving. Funduscopic, foot, neurological, and HEENT exams are benign.
He does have alopecia. He has chronic gastritis, with a soft, nontender abdomen. He has hypertension and dyslipidemia. He has some fatigue, and I gave him a B12 shot of 1000 mcg IM, at his request. He tolerated that nicely.
He is up to date with his tetanus shots. BUN and creatinine, and thyroid functions were checked. We will see him in 2 months, fasting. Urinalysis was negative.
Weight is up 4 pounds to 176.8 at 5 feet 8 inches. Blood pressure is 110/80. Pulse is 67 and regular. He is afebrile. 02 sats are
97% on room air. We will see him in 2 months, fasting.
