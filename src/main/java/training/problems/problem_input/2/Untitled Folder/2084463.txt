Dear Nazmiye E Hatiboglu, MD:
Marcy Stankelis, was seen today June 20, 2019 regarding Coronary artery disease involving native coronary artery of native heart without angina pectoris [125.10].

Reason For Visit: CAD. Essential HTN, Hyperlipidemia. Shortness of breath, Aortic insufficiency with dilated Ascending aorta. Palps/PVCs.
History of Present Illness:
Marcy Stankelis was seen in annual cardiovascular follow-up in the Middletown office.
Significant emotional stress because of the deteriorating health of her daughter (now on chronic oxygen) as well as her husband. Marci has been experiencing epigastric discomfort in the evening. She finds it difficult to describe. There is a question as to whether certain

Patient's Name: Marcy Stankelis MRN: 2000903285 D.O.B: 9/30/1940 foods may make the symptoms more prominent. Obviously is impossible to know whether this is related to reflux symptomatology which seems more likely or underlying
CAD/ischemia. ECG was performed and continues to show T wave inversions in the anterior and inferior leads. We talked about the potential for repeat pharmacologic nuclear stress testing which was last performed in early 2015. Patient is unable to walk extensively because of her arthritis etc.
Recently she has been having more difficulty with using a walker because of severe left shoulder pain. She saw Dr. Larson and there is now consideration of shoulder repair or replacement in the future. Obviously this would entail general anesthesia and I told Marcy, in honest fashion, that she would not be cleared unless we were able to evaluate her cardiac status with the nuclear stress test. I reviewed the process of the Lexiscan sestamibi imaging and she now agrees to the study within the next few weeks.
In the interim, she will use antacids at night to see if there is improvement in her epigastric symptoms. She has not had any melena or obvious signs of GI bleeding. In the future GI evaluation with either endoscopy or barium swallow may be needed. I asked her to speak with Dr.Hatiboglu about whether she should start PPI etc. Marcy's other complaint is progressive fatigue which is been an issue over the past several years. Apparently she was found to have complex thyroid disease and is seen an endocrinologist. I really do not think the low-dose metoprolol is a factor. Emotional stress and sleeping poorly at night are contributing factors.
She has not had any peripheral edema or signs of fluid excess. I asked her to monitor heart rate and blood pressure periodically at home. In the past, she had at least mild aortic and mitral regurgitation but it seems unlikely that this will progress unless blood pressure is an issue.

Patient's Name: Marcy Stankelis MRN: 2000903285 D.O.B: 9/30/1940
Marcy Stankelis was seen today for complex cardiovascular follow-up.
Diagnoses and all orders for this visit:
Coronary artery disease involving native coronary artery of native heart without angina pectoris
Vasodilator SPECT Myocardial Perfusion; Future
-
Essential hypertension
Nonrheumatic aortic valve insufficiency
Dyspnea and respiratory abnormalities
Heart palpitations
Discussed:
Ms Stankelis was seen in the Middletown office for complex cardiovascular followup visit. Multiple medical issues were reviewed with the patient today including the following:
#1.Intermittent epigastric and lower chest pain. Etiology unclear. Clinically this seems most compatible with GERD and reflux symptomatology. However, patient does have underlying
CAD. She will try using antacids or H2 blockers to see if there is improvement. I asked her to monitor whether there is any associated GI bleeding. After extensive discussion she agrees to have repeat pharmacologic nuclear testing performed. This will be a resting
Lexiscan study
#2. CAD. ECG continues to show shallow T wave inversions in the inferior and precordial leads. Plan for objective evaluation with pharmacologic nuclear stress test. She understands it with her symptoms and chronic T wave abnormality on ECG is important to evaluate ischemia especially if she is considering shoulder surgery
#3. Shortness of breath. Multifactorial in etiology. In the past LV function was stable on 2017 echo study
#4. Palpitations/PVC/PSVT. Patient not had any significant symptoms and I think is reasonable to continue with the low dose Toprol which she has tolerated extremely well She understands the need to limit caffeine etc.

#8. Hypertension. Marcy promises to track her BP readings at least weekly. I would have a low threshold to place her on ARB
#9. Severe left shoulder pain with limitation. Suspect that this is related to her diffuse arthritis. Patient is now being considered for shoulder replacement surgery. If her sestamibi study does not show significant ischemia she will be given the 'green light' for surgery but she understands that this will entail a significant rehab process and I am not sure how she will be able to use her rolling walker. Unclear whether there are alternatives to help the arm/shoulder mobility
#10. Prior breast cancer surgery. Apparently she has not had any recurrence and is followed by oncology.
#11. Gait disorder. She will use rolling walker whenever possible. No recent falls
12. Significant emotional stress. Related to her daughter's deteriorating health as well as problems with her husband and his illness
This was a very complex in comprehensive visit. I will call her with results of the upcoming nuclear stress test. She will keep me advised as to whether she wants to proceed with left shoulder surgery. I asked her to touch base with Dr.Hatiboglu in regards to symptoms to help with reflux
Will call me if cardiac symptoms escalate
And to see her back in 4 months
Counseling/Education:
Patient Instructions
Improve efforts at activity with exercise bike
Use antacids like Mylanta or Maalox in evening
Diet with reduction of carbohydrates and saturated fats for expected weight loss
Limit sodium concentration of the diet
Monitor blood pressure and heart rate regularly
Will arrange chemical stress test in near future
Call if new cardiac symptomatology or plans for shoulder surgery
Lab with Dr Hatiboglu
Follow-up in office 4 months
If you have questions, please do not hesitate to call me.

RE: Marcy M Stankelis
D.O.B.: 09/30/1940
Dear Dr. Hatiboglu
Marcy M Stankelis was seen in my office on 06/19/2018 for Annual Office Visit
Cardiovascular History
Marcy Slankelis is a 77 year old female.
Marcy Stankelis was seen in the Middletown office for her annual cardiovascular visit. I had called her last year with the results of her echo study. LV function remains stable with LVH. I was happy to tell her that there was only mild AI and MR which remained the same in comparison to previous baseline. She understands the importance of blood pressure control. I bastard actually monitor BP readings periodically at home. She has not had any palpitations or symptoms related to arrhythmia
She is using a rolling walker and able to go up and down her driveway for and exercise. She is still limited because of her lower back pain . Unfortunately, she also has limited range of motion with her left shoulder pain in part related to severe arthritis of the joint with 'bone-on-bone' morphology. She saw orthopedic surgeon and is not felt to be a candidate for any type of surgical correction given the increased risks and limited success rate
She denies any palpitations or symptoms related to arrhythmia. No peripheral edema or fluid excess. She seems to be sleeping reasonably well at night without evidence of orthopnea, PND or symptoms of sleep apnea.
No chest pain or symptoms related to ischemia. Apparently, lab work has been reasonably stable.
In the past, patient had elevation in her LDL. We had talked about going on generic Crestor 5 mg every other day in the past but she is not interested in changing meds at this point. She will improve diet efforts.

Ms Stankelis was seen in the Middletown office for her annual cardiovascular followup visit.
Multiple medical issues were reviewed with the patient today including the following:
#1.Underlying CAD. Thankfully, Marcy has not had any chest discomfort or symptoms of ischemia. Her prior pharmacologic nuclear stress test in April 2015 was quite stable. Given her multiple medical issues, I do not think that repeat objective assessment is necessary. She has chronic T wave abnormality on ECG
#2. Shortness of breath. Multifactorial in etiology. LV function stable based on echo study last year. No signs or symptoms of fluid excess or true CHF
#3. Palpitations/PVCs/PSVT. Patient remains on low-dose beta blocker which she tolerates well.
She has not had any recurrent palpitations or symptoms to suggest recurrent tachyarrhythmia.
She understands the need to limit caffeine etc.
#4. Hyperlipidemia. In the past, her LDL was elevated but she has been reluctant to consider any pharmacologic treatment. Once again I suggested that she go on generic Crestor 5 mg every other day which I think she would tolerate quite well without side effects
#5. AI/MR. . Only mild MR and TR were identified on July 2017 echo study. She understands the importance of blood pressure control
#6. Dilated Aortic root. Mild increase in diameter was unchanged last year. She understands my concern about labile blood pressure and she will need to monitor BP readings at home. She is reluctant to consider extra medications
#7. Hypertension. Marcy promises to track her BP readings at least weekly . I would have a low threshold to place her on ARB

#8. Low back pain shoulder arthritis. Patient is limited but is not felt to be a surgical candidate for the left arm/shoulder
#9. Prior breast cancer surgery. Apparently she has not had any recurrence and is followed by oncology.
#10. Allen's Gait disorder. She will use rolling walker whenever possible. No recent falls
I think it is reasonable to remain conservative in cardiac management. Asked her to call with any new symptoms. Echo to receive a copy of her upcoming lab work. She will think about using the generic Crestor in the future. I asked her to monitor blood pressure periodically
Plan to see her back in one year.

LAB: T4, Free (Thyroxine Free Ordered for 02/26/2020)
Clinical Notes: Marcy was seen today in follow up. She continues to have subclinical range hyperthyroidism and is asymptomatic. Her thyroid US, shows multiple nodules, all with low suspicion features. One area seems to be a conglomerate nodule which measures up to 3 cm, individual nodule within are smaller. Her uptake and scan was
reviewed today and the dominant left 2.3 cm nodule appears warm, the right conglomerate is not cold but not as wam as the left. Whole gland appears mildly warm. Given her desire to go for surgery for her left shoulder, I will wait 6 months to repeat her thyroid US. If left nodule has grown at all I will consider biopsy of this nodule at that time. If no change will follow yearly. If she develops any new symptoms we will
US or do labs early. She had a 4.7% decline in her bone density at the hip, her spine is non-diagnostic due to significant DJD, and she states they didn't do her am due to her inability to lift it onto the table. It is more likely her decline has to do with decreased mobility, but a chronically suppressed TSH can contribute to bone loss.
We will follow up in 6 months.
2. Multinodular goiter
IMAGING: US - Thyroid (Head Neck, Soft Tissue) (Ordered for 02/26/2020)
Clinical Notes: Multiple nodules seen on thyroid US, largest 2.3 cm. All appear low suspicion carrying 5-10% risk of malignancy. As above, plan for repeat US in 6 months to determine need for biopsy.
