- Statin side effects were discussed, including muscle aches, muscle break down, weakness, liver abnormalities, and allergy. Routine flu blood work discussed.
-
Pt expressed understanding and willingness to follow the care plan.
In summary this is a 79-year-old lady with mitral regurgitation/mitral valve prolapse- status post mitral valve repair 2015, PVD, TIA, COPD, ascending aortic ectasia hypertension, sleep apnea who presents to establish care. She has chronic exertional dyspnea and wheezing from COPD.
Mitral valve prolapse/severe MR status post mitral valve repair.
Will obtain records from her prior cardiologist/ Yale including coronary angiogram, surgical report, echocardiogram etc.
No significant heart murmur audible-since patient has not seen her cardiologist for few years now, echocardiogram will be obtained to reassess cardiac status.
She will need antibiotics prior to any dental work in future.

Maryellen Henderson 01/31/1940
Recent lipid panel shows total cholesterol 180 triglyceride 71 HDL 66 and LDL 100
Recommended patient to start taking aspirin 81 mg by mouth daily with food and atorvastatin 10 mg by mouth daily
CMP and lipid panel will be checked in about 3 months. Recent LFTs were within normal limits. She follows with vascular surgeon.
Advised low-fat low-cholesterol diet.
Ascending aortic ectasia-based on CT scan of the chest in 2015. Echo will be repeated soon to reassess size.
COPD-follow closely with primary care physician for further management.
Isolated episode of atrial fibrillation following valve surgery-patient was never recommended anticoagulation by her cardiologist. I presumed this was immediate perioperative atrial fibrillation which is a normal phenomenon within 48 hours. We will await further records.
EKG today shows sinus rhythm with intermittent PACs. Continue metoprolol
Ilypertension-blood pressure is low however patient is asymptomatic
She is currently on olmesartan 40 mg daily, Lasix 20 mg, metoprolol tartrate 25 mg twice a day and amlodipine 5 mg.
Will discontinue amlodipine because of low blood pressure. Recommended periodic home blood pressure monitoring and to contact me if more than 140/90 mmHg. Recommended low-sodium diet
Sleep apnea-recommended patient to use CPAP regularly.
Patient instructions:
Mixed hyperlipidemia
Atorvastatin Calcium 10 MG tablet, 1 every bedtime, 30 days, 6 refills
 Other
Follow-Up
In 3 months with echocardiogram
Follow-Up
Please obtain release of information signed by patient to get cardiac records from yale
Hospital-patient had mitral valve repair at yale 2 years ago - need angiogram, echo,, surgical details and discharge summary
 Presence of prosthetic heart valve
MCA Testing/Echo: Echo
Instructions: Status post mitral valve repair-? Mitral clip, frequent PACs, hypertension
.
 An echocardiogram
Return to the clinic if condition worsens or new symptoms arise
- Monitor and record your blood pressure at home. Bring the blood pressure record to you next office appointment.
- Change your diet to a low carbohydrate, low saturated fat diet (< 7% of calorie intake), such as a
'Mediterranean' type or 'DASH' type diet, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes and nuts.
Eat in moderation. Favor fish over red meats.
- Reduce daily salt (sodium) intake to <2,300 mg a day, and even bet <1,500 mg a day.

7 Germantown Road, Suite 28
HPI:
The patient is a 78 year-old female presenting for 6 month follow-up of PAD in the bilateral legs. She is accompanied by her daughter for today's office visit. She previously had pressure sores in the right foot which has completely resolved.
She has no new wounds or ulcerations. She denies claudication or rest pain.

Plan:
 Follow-up for re-examination 9 months
 Medication: No new medications at this time
The patient is a 78 year-old female with asymptomatic PAD in the bilateral legs. Noninvasive testing in my office reveals multilevel stenosis in the bilateral legs which is unchanged since previous imaging. She remains completely asymptomatic of PAD at this time with no wounds or ulcerations. I recommended conservative follow-up every 9 months unless she develops claudication, rest pain or nonhealing wounds. She verbalized understanding and scheduled her follow-up as advised.
Discussed risks and benefits with patient and patient understood intructions.
Sincerely, Nicole L Millo, APRN
