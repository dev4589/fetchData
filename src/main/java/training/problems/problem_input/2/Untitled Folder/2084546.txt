For someone with known diabetes, a value <7% indicates that their diabetes is well controlled and a value greater than or equal to 7% indicates suboptimal control. Ale targets should be individualized based on duration of diabetes, age, comorbid conditions, and other considerations.
Currently, no consensus exists regarding use of hemoglobin Alc for diagnosis of diabetes for children.
