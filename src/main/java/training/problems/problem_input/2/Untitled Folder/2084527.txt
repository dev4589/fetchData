Cardiovascular History
Dorothy Bowen is a 73 year old female.
Patient stated that she couldn't able to tolerate flecainide and went back to metoprolol succinate which she takes 25 mg twice a day and Cardizem CD 120 mg twice a day but she stated that her blood pressure was down with twice a day Cardizem and therefore she is taking only once a day.
She has had previous of palpitation but she stated that it does not make her anxious that much.
 Medication list reviewed.
No partial visual field loss No blurred vision
Palpitations ~ No chest pain or discomfort' The heart rate was not slowNo intermittent leg claudication
O
 Dyspnea Not feeling congested in the chest No paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea No orthopnea No wheezing
 No dizziness' No lightheadedness' No fainting

 Mixed hyperlipoproteinemia
#1. Paroxysmal supra-ventricular tachycardia
#2. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
#3. Ilypertension
#4. Hyperlipidemia
#5. History of Lyme disease.
#6. Bilateral carotid bruit.
 Continue current medication.
 Clinical summary provided to patient.
Reviewed Pt received screening for fall risk.
.
 Instructions for patient Flecainide 50 mg twice daily
 Education and counseling: Pt educated about strategies to avoid fall risk
Atrial fibrillation
This is paroxysmal. At present she is in sinus rhythm. She will be continued on Xarelto 20 mg daily. She has not had any recent episodes of bleeding. Patient has been experiencing episodes of palpitation and therefore she was started on flecainide which she did not tolerate well. And therefore this was stopped.. At present she is on Cardizem CD 120 mg twice daily and metoprolol succinate 25 mg twice daily. However she is taking Cardizem CD only once daily since she states that it brings her blood pressure down. Therefore I have today increased heart
Cardizem CD to 180 milligrams daily. She will be seen in the office in one month.
Hypertension
Blood pressure is well controlled. She will be continued on atenolol chlorthalidone 50/25 mg daily. No evidence of congestive heart failure or fluid overload.
Hyperlipidemia
LDL is at goal LFTs are normal. She was advised to continue on pravastatin 40 mg daily. She will have CMP and lipid panel done prior to her next visit in 6 months.
 Return to the clinic if condition worsens or new symptoms arise
 Follow-up visit 1 month
- In addition to the medication changes discussed, continue your other current cardiac medications.

FINDINGS:
Increased reticular nodular subpleural infiltrates in the posterior lower lobes with new nodules including 6 mm posterior right lower
lobe and 5 mm subpleural lateral left lower lobe nodules. Able 8 mm perihilar medial left lower lobe nodule. Stable scarring in the posterior right upper lobe and medial left apex. Stable bibasilar scar. Stable moderate emphysematous changes.
No pleural or pericardial effusion. Normal heart size. No thoracic aortic aneurysm. No evident adenopathy.
Stable 10 mm rim calcification in the left upper quadrant adjacent to the spleen consistent with small splenic artery aneurysm. Stable pancreatic calcifications, probably arterial. No acute bony abnormality. Chronic moderate T11 compression fracture.
IMPRESSION:
1. Increased reticulonodular infiltrates and nodules in the posterior lower lobes bilaterally. Stable 8 mm left lower lobe nodule. The pattern is consistent with a post inflammatory process however malignancy cannot be completely excluded.
2. COPD.

Note Date: 08/19/2019
Name: Dorothy Bowen
MRN: 16329
Location: Middletown
DOB: 04/09/1945
Attending Physician: Michael Farrell (Medical Oncology)
Date: 08/19/2019
Primary Diagnosis
Ovarian cancer ( Stage Date: Unknown, Stage FIGO IIIB (Left ovary, T3b, NX, CMO)-Clinical
Date of Dx:07/11/2019 Histopathologic Type: Other; Histopathologic Type: Other; Histologic Grade: Unknown; Lymph-Vascular
Invasion: Unknown; Laterality: Left; Tumor Size (cm): 11.3; )
Chief Complaint
Nadir visit following cycle #1 of Carboplatin (Taxol held due to decreased performance status)
Post hospital follow up for sepsis, PNA, UTI, fever, altered mental status.
HPI
Patient is a 74-year-old female with significant past medical history of atrial fibrillation, COPD, hypertension, hyperlipidemia; admitted with abdominal complaints over the past few weeks, associated with early satiety, decreased appetite, for whom she saw on evaluation the emergency room for further evaluation. She also had complaints of diarrhea.
Upon admission she was discovered leukocytosis and thrombocythemia. Chest x-ray was concerning for an infiltrative process, for which broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated, and she was placed on the sepsis pathway.
CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis performed for further evaluation demonstrated significant ascites, and studding concerning for carcinomatosis, and left-sided adnexal mass.
During admission she underwent CA-125 evaluation, which is over 1000. She underwent a 2.2 L diagnostic and therapeutic paracentesis.
she ultimately required biopsy of an omental metastatic lesion to establish diagnosis, which revealed: Metastatic Adenocarcinoma.
Overall, the findings are most compatible with a GYN primary.
notably during her hospitalization, she was also treated for acquired pneumonia, and was noted to have been above normal serum creatinine of 1.5 with an estimated GFR 34. She also developed hypernatremia and hyperkalemia likely secondary to persistent diarrhea. She was also found with urinary tract infection, and treated. She did have renal insufficiency, acute on chronic, for which she was treated with IV fluids. Ultrasound did not demonstrate any obstruction. Was felt that she had an injury given hypotension during her hospital stay. He was also started on Remeron for appetite stimulation.
She started chemotherapy with q3 week Carbo/Taxol on 7/20/19. Taxol held at that time due to decreased performance status.
Interim History
She returns today for follow up. She started oral Lasix last week for lower extremity swelling.
She notes improvement in her swelling since last week. She continues to void frequently.
Notes that she is now eating a little bit better, taking 6 small meals/snacks a day. She does have taste changes (metallic) which predates therapy. She is moving her bowels without difficulty.
She had difficulty with Remeron with sedation, confusion and aggressive behaviors. This has now been discontinued.

Clinical Impression
Patient is a 74-year-old female, admitted to Middlesex Hospital in July 2019 with symptomatic abdominal complaints; discovered on CT
scan with left-sided adnexal mass measuring 11 centimeters, ascites, studding to the diaphragm, left-sided greater than right sided pleural effusion; for which she underwent diagnostic and therapeutic paracentesis. While those results were negative. Pathologically, she ultimately underwent CT-guided biopsy of one of the omental masses, biopsy proven adenocarcinoma consistent with a GYN primary. This in conjunction with elevated CA-125 tumor marker greater than 1000, findings consistent with gynecologic primary likely having arisen from the left ovary (ovarian versus fallopian tube primary).
She has undergone evaluation by gynecologic oncology, in light of her comorbidities including COPD, atrial fibrillation, favored neoadjuvant chemotherapy approach with 3 cycles of every three-week Taxol/carboplatin followed by reevaluation for interval debulking
surgery, followed thereafter by another 3 cycles of chemotherapy with carboplatin and Taxol (for a total of 6 cycles).
She started cycle #1 of q3 week Carbo/Taxol on 7/30/19. Taxol held with treatment due decreased performance status. She was admitted to the hospital with confusion, fever, sepsis and UTI. She had a left sided thoracentesis, PRBCs and iron infusion while hospitalized.
Lasix was added last week due to increased lower extremity edema. This is slowly improving. Her potassium level was elevated. She will decrease her intake of potassium rich foods.
Given difficulty with delirum and confusion through chemotherapy will plan to decrease her pre-medication of dexamethasone to 8mg, twelve hours and 6 hours prior to infusion. Most of her confusion was attributed to Mirtazipine and this has since been discontinued. I reviewed this with the patient and her daughter.
Plan
1. Weight gain/fluid overload
secondary to fluid retention
s/p thoracentesis of left lung
Continue Lasix 20mg daily.
Monitor potassium levels.
.
2. Early satiety, nausea, taste changes
Continue follow up with dietician.
 recommend discontinue Remeron in light of mental status changes and increased fatigue
 Marinol considered, however in light of mental status changes associated with Remeron, recommend against at this time.
Megace considered, however in light of decreased ambulation, concern for thrombosis is considerable
 maximize conservative management; continue small meals and nutritional supplements.
3. gynecologic primary consistent with primary ovarian/fallopian tube adenocarcinoma
s/p cycle #1 every 4 week carboplatin ( Taxol held secondary to decreased performance status)
CA-125 completed and significant above normal, over 1000 ; monitor CA 125 referral made to genetic counseling
 
4. Strength deconditioning

Follow-up(s) Pending: PCP, Oncology.
Summary of Records: 74-yo woman with a past medical h/o chronic a-fib on Xarelto, htn, and COPD who presented from home with a one-week h/o DOE, intermittent diarrhea as well as abdominal bloating and decreased oral intake. She denied having any chest pain, dizziness or syncope. She noted beginning to take Imodium for diarrhea which stopped however she continued to have very little appetite and felt full constantly. Based on her continued symptoms she decided to come to the ED for further evaluation and management. In the ED, pt was noted to be hypotensive, tachycardic and 2. Routine blood work revealed an elevated wbc count of 16 and a platelet count of 1120. Chest x-ray was obtained which revealed consolidation consistent with pneumonia. In addition CT of the abdomen and pelvis
was obtained which revealed an 11 x 8 cm well-defined cystic mass in the left adnexa causing displacement of the uterus as well as moderate ascites. Pt was placed on the septic pathway and broad antibiotics with IV azithromycin, Zosyn and vancomycin for treatment of sepsis secondary to pneumonia. Please note that sepsis was present on admission with leukocytosis, tachycardia, tachypnea and clear source of infection.
Pt had modest improvement in her sx during the course of the stay. She was seen in consultation by GYN ONC well as oncology. Pt is felt to have likely gynecologic malignancy, ovarian versus fallopian with carcinomatosis and ascites. Plan is for neoadjuvant chemotherapy, followed by possible debulking surgery and repeat chemotherapy based on progress. Please see this consult notes for details, greatly appreciate their input. Pt underwent Port-A-Cath placement as well as left-sided thoracentesis on 7/3/2019. Pt has

Notes: HEART DISEASE
ASCVD (atherosclerotic coronary vascular disease, heart disease/heart attack) risk can be estimated using tools from the American Heart
Association & the American College of Cardiology and the NIH. The tools also show who is likely to benefit from 'statin' drugs. There is both a website and a smartphone app (ASCVD Risk Estimator)
http://tools.cardiosource.org/ASCVD-Risk-Estimator/
http://cvdrisk.nhlbi.nih.gov/
CANCER Risks & Screening:
1. Lung cancer: Continue not to smoke. Lung cancer screening is now available for patients with a long history of smoking.
2. Breast cancer screening usually starts at age 40. There are emerging breast imaging technologies that may be beneficial. The type of breast imaging and frequency of breast imaging may depend on prior results.
The National Cancer Institute has a Breast Cancer Risk Assessment

3. Colon cancer screening usually starts at age 50: Colonoscopy is the gold standard to screen for colon cancer. Frequency may depend on prior results. Fecal occult blood testing done at home or in the office is done annually between colonoscopies. The National Cancer Institute has a Colon Cancer Risk Assessment Tool:
http://www.cancer.gov/colorectalcancerrisk/
4. Skin: protect your skin from the sun. Skin Cancer Risks: ABCDE's
(Asymmetric lesion, Border irregularity, multiple Colors, Diameter >
6mm, Evolution of symptoms such as tenderness or bleeding.
ACCIDENTS
Wear your seatbelt. Don't drive drowsy. Dont drive distracted.
Keep in mind alcohol, substances and emotions contribute to accidents.
VACCINES
Recommended vaccines: Flu shot annually. Tetanus every 10 years.
Shingles ix at age 60. Pneumonia: there is a two shot series of pneumonia shots starting at age 65 (pneumococcal 23), and a second shot (Prevnar -13) 6-12 months later. For people with chronic disease or immune suppression, pneumoccal vaccine is advised every 5 years.
HEALTHY LIVING
Diet: Low salt, low carb, high fiber diet. Vegetarian diet has been associated with less heart disease and other diets. Mediterranean Diet has been shown to decrease heart disease. Exercise: Daily aerobic exercise, at least 30 mins per day. 30 minutes weight bearing exercise at least three days a week for bone strength. Exercise has a multitude of benefits including heart and vascular disease, diabetes, arthritis, mental health and cognition.
ADVANCED DIRECTIVES

Hospital Course
74-year-old female with a past medical history of A. fib on Xarelto, hypertension, COPD, recent admission last month for pneumonia with incidental finding of ovarian cancer; who presented to the Shoreline ED tonight

-------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------
from home with abdominal distention. On her recent hospital admission from 6/30- 7/15/2019 she was treated for sepsis secondary to community-acquired pneumonia. Found to have adrenal mass secondary to ovarian cancer, carcinomatosis, ascites and pleural effusion without malignancy; severe protein malnutrition. She was seen in consultation with GYN oncology as well as oncology service. Plans are for neoadjuvant chemotherapy and possible debulking surgery. She had a Port-A-Cath placement and began chemo this past Tuesday July 30th. Patient states that since her chemotherapy, she has felt exhausted and drained, but states that her appetite has actually returned and she's been eating and drinking better. She denies any chest pain or shortness of breath, denies any nausea vomiting or diarrhea. Reports some mild constipation with last bowel movement being 3 days ago it was normal. She reports urinary frequency over the last 3 or 4 days. Denies any fevers or chills. Reports pressure-like tenderness to her abdomen diffusely. Per report, family states she has also had some confusion which has been progressive over the past week. Evidently, the visiting nurse came to the house today and found that she was hypoxic into the upper 70s thus encouraging pt to go to the EDIn the Shoreline ED, she was found to be hypoxic with sats of 85% on RA for which she was placed on 2L of nasal canula. She was found to be hypotensive with SBPs as low as 70s for which she received approximately 2.5L of crystalloids with slight improvement in BP. She undersent a CT of her head given confusion in the setting of blood thinners, but this did not show any acute abnormality. She also underwent a CT of her abdomen which showed the large cystic mass in the pelvis with diffuse abdominal ascites and carcinomatosis which was similar to her prior studies, as well as increased bilateral pleural effusions with consolidative changes in the left base. UA was positive. She was pan-cultured and started on abx with gentimycin and aztreonam which were then broaded with levoquin and vanco. She eventually was placed on minimal dose of Levophed for BP support and subsequently admitted to the CCU.Pt arrives to the CCU with adequate mentation, pleasantly conversing and appropriately oriented. She requested to use a commode immediately to void. Her BPs were in the 120s on 2mcg/kg/min of levophed which was then turned off and BPs remained stable in the 120s systolic.
74-year-old woman with a past medical history of recently diagnosed ovarian cancer with abdominal carcinomatosis and ascites, chronic atrial fibrillation on the Xarelto, hypertension and COPD with recent hospitalization approximately one month ago for sepsis secondary to pneumonia who presented from home with a 3 to four-day history of increased confusion, increased abdominal swelling. Patient is in her usual state of health until undergoing her first round of chemotherapy on 7/30/2019 for her ovarian cancer. Plans are for neoadjuvant chemotherapy and possible debulking surgery in the near future. Since this chemotherapy, patient reported feeling exhausted, drained however has noted a return of her appetite. She denied having any chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. She did note some increased urinary frequency however denied any fever or chills. Per the family, patient has exhibited some confusion which progressed over several days prior to arrival. Patient had a visiting nurse evaluated her on day of admission and patient was found to be hypoxic in the upper 70s and was directed to the ED for further evaluation and management. In the ED, patient was found to be hypoxic with O2 saturation of 85% on room air. She was placed on 2 L nasal cannula 02. She was also found to be hypotensive with systolic blood pressures as low as 70s for which she received 2 and a half liters of crystalloid with slight
improvement in blood pressure. Given her confusion, CT of the head was obtained which was negative for any acute abnormality. CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a large cystic mass in the pelvis with diffuse abdominal ascites and carcinomatosis, similar to prior studies. Urinalysis was obtained which was suspicious for a UTI. Patient was pancultured and placed on antibiotics with IV gentamicin and aztreonam, broadened to levofloxacin and vancomycin. She did have persistent hypotension and was placed on a low-dose of Levophed for blood pressure support, subsequently admitted to the CCU service. Patient has had gradual improvement in her symptoms during the course of her stay. Patient did undergo a diagnostic and therapeutic

-------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------
left-sided thoracentesis 8/7/2019 with drainage of 1.1 liters and significant improvement in her respiratory status. Anticoagulation was held since admission in anticipation of possible intervention such as paracentesis/thoracentesis. Xarelto was restarted on 8/8/2019. Hemoglobin did decrease to 7 on 08/09/19.
Given her overall clinical picture, she would benefit from transfusion of a unit of packed red blood cells as well as holding Xarelto. There is no clear evidence of bleeding however patient will need to monitor closely given his drop in hemoglobin. Blood transfusion will also likely help her respiratory status.
PLAN:
#1. Acute hypoxic respiratory failure - Resolved following thoracentesis. It was due to volume overload, bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis and possible gram negative pneumonia present on admission and abdominal distention from ovarian cancer with carcinomatosis.-S/P Rx with vancomycin and aztreonam from 8/3/2019 to 8/10/2019. Patient did meet criteria on admission for acute hypoxic respiratory failure with new O2 requirement, tachypnea and hypoxia present on admission. She has been weaned off of supplemental oxygen and continues to improve clinically following thoracentesis. No clinical indication for right-sided thoracentesis at this time. -Echocardiogram from 7/2/2019-technically difficult study. Normal EF of 65%. No wall motion abnormalities. Chest x-ray from 8/3/2019-moderate left and small right pleural effusion. Patchy airspace disease at lung bases left greater than right. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast from 8/3/2019 showed emphysema and pleural effusion at the lung bases.
Considered significant Changes at the left lung base progress from prior. Moderate hiatal hernia. Chest x-ray from 8/7/2019 showed bilateral pleural effusion with parenchymal densities at both lung bases compatible with either infiltrate or compressive atelectasis. Compared to prior study minimal increase in size of right-sided pleural effusion. she is not on home oxygen.
#2. Bilateral pleural effusions- transudative -due to movement of fluid from peritoneum. Pleural fluid cytology was negative on 7/2/2019. Significantly improved following left-sided thoracentesis on 8/7/2019.-if she continues to have recurrent left-sided pleural effusion, an option would be a pleural catheter for intermittent drainage. Advised that this was not necessarily clinically indicated at this time however something to consider if she continues to have a reaccumulation of fluid.
#3. Malignant ascites. Remains stable, however no significant fluid amenable to paracentesis. In the setting of known ovarian cancer with carcinomatosis.
#4. Septic shock secondary to Presumed UTI and possible gram negative pneumonia Present on admission = Resolved. She did meet criteria for severe sepsis on admission with significant hypotension requiring 2.5 L bolus and norepinephrine drip, tachypnea, tachycardia and suspected source of infection. Urine culture did not reveal any significant organisms however patient is clinically improving. S/P Rx with aztreonam from 08/03/19 to 08/10/19, S/P Rx with vancomycin from 08/03/19 to 08/10/19. -Blood culture 2-from
8/3/2019-negative. MRSA screening test negative on 8/4/2019. Pleural fluid culture negative on 8/7/2019.
Urinalysis from 8/3/2019 showed 30 mg/dL proteinuria, 9-15 WBC per low -power field, small leukocyte
esterase, moderate bacteria, 1 4 squamous epithelial cells per low power field-Urine culture from 8/3/2019 grew coagulase-negative staphylococcus likely contamination versus colonization.
#5. Chronic atrial fibrillation on Xarelto. Patient has remained rate controlled on home regimen of diltiazem and metoprolol. Resume xarelto as this is anemia of chronic disease.

-------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------
#6. Acute on Chronic anemia of chronic disease. As noted above, And hemoglobin. S/P 1 unit of packed red blood cells on 08/09/19. H/H Improved as expected. Repeat H/H remain stable in last 48 hours.
#7. DVT prophylaxis - SCD given due to anemia.
#8. All other chronic conditions. Continue home regimen unless contraindicated.
#9. Disposition = PT consult from 08/07/19 - home with home PT/OT and HHA. but her mobility has significantly impaired.

-
COMPARISON: Thoracentesis 7/3/2019.
SEDATION: Local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine.
TECHNIQUE:
After informed, written consent, the patient was positioned sitting upright on the side of the bed. Ultrasound images were obtained of the left posterior chest, and an appropriate access site was marked.
After standard timeout was performed, the site was sterilely prepped and draped in the typical fashion, using maximal barrier precaution technique. Local anesthesia was administered with 1% lidocaine.
Using ultrasound guidance, a 4 French catheter was then gently guided into the pleural space. Ultrasound images were saved before and after needle entry and stored into PACS. Approximately 1.1 liters of straw-colored fluid was removed. Samples were sent for analysis.
Visual specimen verification was performed.
The catheter was then removed during breath-hold, and hemostasis was achieved with manual pressure. A sterile occlusive dressing was applied.
The patient tolerated the procedure without immediate complication.
FINDINGS:
Left pleural effusion with appropriate access site for thoracentesis.
IMPRESSION:
Successful ultrasound-guided left thoracentesis, with removal of 1.1 liters of straw-colored fluid.

CLINICAL INDICATION: bilateral pleural effusions/l/Pt.s fullness at bottom of chest radiating up. htn former smoker x30 -35 yrs 1/2ppd
PROTOCOL:
Chest, 2 views, Frontal and Lateral views
COMPARISON: August 3, 2019
FINDINGS:
Again seen are bilateral pleural effusions with strandy parenchymal densities at both lung bases compatible with either infiltrates or regions of compressive atelectasis. Since the prior study, minimal increase in size of the right-sided pleural effusion has occurred.
The fusion of the left remains larger than the right and the overall appearance of the left base is unchanged. Above findings are not associated with abnormal pleural or vascular cephalization or more generalized interstitial prominence with heart size remaining within normal limits. No change in Port-A-Cath position is seen and no bony change is apparent as well.
IMPRESSION:
Persistent bilateral pleural effusions and parenchymal atelectasis/infiltrates involving both bases. Aside from minimal increase in size of right pleural effusion there has been no significant change.

Reason for Appointment
1. Pulm nodule
History of Present Illness
General HPI:
I saw Ms. Bowen in consultation today at the request of Dr. ridge for evaluation of shortness of breath and multiple pulmonary nodules. She is a 73-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on xarelto, approximately 25-pack-year smoking history, quit in the early 2000s, hypertension. She tells me that over the last year or so she has noticed a decline in her exercise tolerance. She is getting more short of breath with less exertion. She cites this past summer as a particularly bad one given the high humidity. She even spent a night in the hospital as result of her breathing problems.
She was once told that she had COPD but has never formally used inhalers. She has not required any systemic corticosteroids. She denies any chest pain associated with her shortness of breath. She also denies any active infectious symptoms.
In June 2017 she had a CTA of the chest performed due to shortness of breath and chest pain. It was negative for PE but did show an incidental 7 mm solid nodule in the right lower lung field. A follow-up CAT scan of the chest in December 2017 showed a stable right lower lobe nodule and a new 8 mm left lower lobe nodule. Again, she had a follow-up CAT scan in May 2018 which did show increased reticular nodular opacities in the bilateral lower lobes and a stable appearing 8 mm nodule on the left.
Her mother had lung cancer. She is retired and was formerly a plastics inspector. She denies any significant weight changes, night sweats, hem ysis, and her appetite has been stable. All above mentioned imaging was personally reviewed by myself as well as the corresponding radiology reports.

GORALNIK, JUSTING 10/11/2018 09:35:17 AM EDT > Emphysema
Notes: In office spirometry results:
FEV1/FVC (best): 53%
FEV1: 0.99 L or 45%
Flow volume loop consistent with obstruction
FEV1 consistent with severe obstruction
Recommendation based on gold criteria would be to initiate at least combination inhaler therapy if not triple therapy in addition to a rescue inhaler. This was discussed in detail with the patient.
She would prefer to hold off on maintenance inhalers. She is willing to try a rescue inhaler. This will be e prescribed today.
Resting oxygen saturation 96%
I will see her back in 6 months.
2. Multiple pulmonary nodules
Notes: 7 mm right lower lobe nodule
8 mm left lower lobe nodule
Both stable since June 2017.
Per Fleischner guidelines, multiple solid nodules between 6 and 8 mm in high risk individual warrant follow-up 3-6 months and 18-24 months. She has already completed her 6 month follow-up CAT scan. Plan to repeat CAT scan of the chest in March or
April 2019. A future order for this will be placed today.

73 yo F with Hx of PAF, HTN, lung nodule, osteoporiosis here for routine FU. Had a mechanica fall on a throw rug during the night at home. In the fall she hurt her right knee and right hand. Came here and was seen by Lauren. Injuries have resolved. FU pulmonary nodule with Churs 4/11/19 and follow up with Dr. Goralnik 5/9/19. PAF has been under good control. AF is exacerbated by panic. Her panic has been controlled. FU with Dr. Aithal is in June.
Cologuard was negative.
Treatment
1. Others
Notes: For the time being, having reviewed her history, recent results, and planned follow-up, will not order any new tests today. She has follow-up lab testing including CMP and lipid panel with Dr. Aithal.
She has CAT scan of the chest to follow-up on the pulmonary nodule.
Her A. fib is controlled her blood pressure is controlled. She is anticoagulated. We will readdress the osteoporosis. She has addressed to some degree her fall risk. I will see her again in January or sooner if needed. We did discuss that the summertime heavy humid air can be more difficult than she might want to use her inhalers during that season. She agrees and will discuss this also with Dr. Goralnik.

Notes:
HEART DISEASE
ASCVD (atherosclerotic coronary vascular disease, heart disease/heart attack) risk can be estimated using tools from the American Heart
Association & the American College of Cardiology and the NIH. The tools also show who is likely to benefit from 'statin' drugs. There is both a website and a smartphone app (ASCVD Risk Estimator)
http://tools.cardiosource.org/ASCVD-Risk-Estimator/
http://cvdrisk.nhlbi.nih.gov/
CANCER Risks & Screening:
