Skin: no rash present and no lesions.

Discussion/Summary
The patient has significant progressive aortic stenosis which is becoming severe. She is asymptomatic but it leads a very quiet and active lifestyle.. I am concerned and will further evaluate this with a low level stress echocardiogram this summer. We will evaluate her exercise tolerance, her blood pressure response, LV and RV response, and evaluate the peak exercise aortic gradient. Based on these findings we can make recommendations regarding how aggressive to get. She may warrant valve replacement in the near future. The stress evaluation will help determine this.
No other changes are necessary at this time. The patient will proceed with low level aerobic walking and exercise in the next few weeks to get ready for the stress test

Presenting Problem/History of Present Illness
Acute SOB and chest pain
Hospital Course
Lorraine Adamson is a pleasant 83 year old female whose primary cardiologist is Dr. Insel. Patient has a past medical history of aortic stenosis, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, iron deficiency anemia and chronic back pain. She presented to an outside hospital with complaints of shortness of breath x 2 days. On the day of admission she awoke around midnight with acute shortness of breath and chest pain. EMS was called and she was found to be severely hypoxic with an O2 SAT of 70%. She was placed on CPAP support and transferred to the OSH. In the ER, she was treated with IV lasix and her troponin was initially normal. She was transferred to Hartford
Hospital for evaluation of aortic stenosis for question of TAVR, CHF management, and cath for NSTEMI/potential TAVR. Upon admission to Hartford Hospital, her troponin was elevated to 1.9.
She was initiated on a heparin drip. Patient was admitted to the Cardiology Hospitalist service and Dr. Mansoor was consulted.
Upon arrival, she was kept NPO and arrangements were made for a cardiac catheterization. Prior to transfer to Hartford, the patient had an Echocardiogram.The echo noted that her global left ventricular systolic function was normal. The estimated left ventricular ejection fraction was 60-65%.
Mild eccentric left ventricular hypertrophy was present. Left ventricular cavity size iwas normal. Grade Il diastolic dysfunction was demonstrated. Her right ventricular size and systolic function were
Normal and moderate aortic insufficiency was seen. She demonstrated a calcified aortic valve with severe aortic stenosis. The peak velocity measured through the aortic valve was4.97m/sec, with a mean gradient of 63.5mmHg
Patient continued to be followed by the structural heart team and was cleared for discharge after she completed the CTA of the chest/abdomen/and pelvis. It was noted during her admission that she was anemic. Her H&H on admission was 8.8&28.9 and dropped to 7.2 & 24.3. She has a history of iron deficiency anemia which required prior RBC transfusion several years ago. Iron studies were repeated during this admission and her iron was low at 21, iron SAT of 7 and her
Ferritin level as low at 22. A stool sample was obtained by digital examination at the bed side and was heme negative. As a result, the decision was made to initiate BID iron therapy and an outpatient Referral to Quest lab was generated for a CBC to be obtained on January 9th.
Mrs. Adamson is stable for discharge to home. She is hemodynamically stable, tolerating po and ambulating ad lib. 10 point review of systems is negative. She will be contacted by the Structural
Heart Team when to return for her TAVR. In the interim, she has been advised to contact Dr. Insel or her PCP with any other questions or concerns.

CTA CORE VALVE
CT ANGIOGRAPHY CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST
CT ANGIOGRAPHY ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST
CLINICAL INFORMATION:
TAVR core valve protocol; aortic stenosis.
COMPARISON:
None
TECHNIQUE:
Volume acquisition CT of chest, abdomen and pelvis was performed both before and after the administration of IV contrast. A total of 80 mL of Omnipaque
350 was utilized for the contrast-enhanced portion of the exam. Images were evaluated on an independent dedicated 3D workstation and 3D images were reconstructed and evaluated. A 3D model of the aorta was created and measurements were performed of the aorta. In addition, a 3D model of the abdominal and pelvic aorto-iliac-femoral vessels was also created along with curved reformat tracking.
Specific vascular measurements were made during diastole, including the distance from the top of the right coronary artery to the annulus, the distance from the top of the left coronary artery to the annulus and the height of the sinus of Valsalva to the noncoronary cusp. The sinus of Valsalva diameters during diastole were also measured. The diameter of the aorta 40 mm above the annulus is reported. During systole, the maximal diameter of the annulus is reported (the major aortic annulus diameter) along with the diameter perpendicular to this (the minor aortic annulus diameter).

In addition, measurements of abdominal aorta and iliofemoral vessels are also reported.
All of these specific vascular measurements are documented in PACs.
DLP:
1756.8 mGy-cm
FINDINGS:
VASCULAR:
The aortic valve is calcified. The ascending thoracic aorta is normal in course and caliber without aneurysmal dilatation or dissection. There is a normal three-vessel aortic arch. There is a small amount calcification at the origin of the left subclavian artery without evidence of a hemodynamically significant stenosis. The visualized great vessels are patent without evidence of a hemodynamically significant stenosis. There is atherosclerotic calcification at the carotid bifurcations bilaterally. The descending thoracic aorta is normal in course and caliber without aneurysmal dilatation or dissection. The abdominal aorta is mild to moderately diseased with calcified and noncalcified atherosclerotic plaque. No abdominal aortic aneurysm. The common iliac arterial systems are widely patent.
There is calcified and noncalcified atherosclerotic plaque at the origin of the celiac and SMA with less than 50% narrowing. The IMA is patent. There are single renal arteries bilaterally which are patent.
NON-VASCULAR:
Lungs: Respiratory motion degrades image quality in the lungs. There are several nodular opacities throughout the right lung measuring up to 5 mm;
example lesions are 5 mm nodular opacity in the right upper lobe
(311/1118), a 4 mm nodular opacity in the right upper lobe (215/1118) and a 2 mm nodular opacity also in the right upper lobe (235/1118). Additionally, there are scattered bilateral calcified granulomas in both lungs. There are bilateral small pleural effusions, left greater than right, with dependent atelectasis.
Mediastinum: The heart size is mildly enlarged. There are coronary artery calcifications. No pericardial effusion. There are prominent mediastinal lymph nodes, the largest in the subcarinal station measures 1,5 cm. No axillary lymphadenopathy.
Liver, Gallbladder, Bile Ducts: No focal hepatic lesions or intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The gallbladder appears to be surgically absent.
Pancreas: The pancreas is unremarkable.
Spleen: Unremarkable.

Adrenal Glands, Kidneys, Ureters, Bladder: No adrenal nodules or masses.
The kidneys enhance symmetrically. No renal mass. No hydronephrosis. The urinary bladder is well distended without evidence of wall thickening.
Pelvis: There are coarse calcifications in the uterus likely due to calcified fibroids. No adnexal mass appreciated.
Bones: There has been posterior fusion at L2 through L5 with laminectomy changes. Degenerative changes in the spine. No destructive bony lesions are appreciated. Degenerative changes in the right hip with subchondral sclerosis and subchondral cystic change and prominent osteophyte formation.
Lymph Nodes: No abdominal or pelvic lymphadenopathy.
Bowel: No evidence of bowel obstruction. Colonic diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
IMPRESSION:
1. A 3D model of the aorta was created and measurements were performed of the aorta. In addition, a 3D model of the abdominal and pelvic aorto-iliac-femoral vessels was also created along with curved reformat tracking. These values are reported in the PACS system.
2. There are 2-5 mm nodular opacities in the right lung as described.
According to the UPDATED 2017 Fleischner Society recommendations, the advised follow up imaging for solid nodules < 6 mm is:
LOW-RISK PATIENT: No routine follow up.
HIGH-RISK PATIENT: Optional CT at 12 months.
3. Nonspecific prominent lymph nodes in the mediastinum measuring up to
1.5
cm in the subcarinal station.
4. Small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.

CT chest without contrast (axial sections with sagittal and coronal reformats) (December 26, 2018 at 02:34 hours)
Clinical history: Dyspnea, respiratory distress.
Technique: Helical axial sections of the chest were obtained without contrast. Iterative reconstruction technique was employed to reduce patient radiation exposure.
Findings:
There is ill-defined ground-glass attenuation in the lungs bilaterally, right more than left. Bibasilar streaky atelectasis is present. There is mild interstitial septal thickening. There is a 2 mm calcified granuloma in the right upper lobe posteriorly
(axial image 9). There is a 3 mm nodule in the right upper lobe (axial images 22). Small-to- moderate bilateral pleural effusions are seen. There is no pneumothorax.
There are a few prominent mediastinal lymph nodes, the largest measuring
1.1 cm at the carina. There is mild cardiomegaly. Coronary artery calcification is noted. The aorta demonstrates atheromatous calcification without evidence of aneurysm. There is minimal pericardial effusion.
Degenerative changes are identified in the spine, Lumbar spinal fusion is seen.
Nonspecific perinephric fat stranding is noted bilaterally. The other visualized upper abdominal viscera have an unremarkable noncontrast appearance.
