 Peripheral arterial disease
 Obstructive emphysema
 Mixed hyperlipoproteinemia
This is a 74-year-old man with coronary disease who underwent CABG just over 2 years ago. He has comorbid peripheral arterial disease, mild aortic stenosis, hypertension, dyslipidemia. He is without angina, and he does not have signs or symptoms of heart failure. Since there is some blood pressure lability, I have recommended a sleep study.
Have also recommended a regimented approach, really making sure that he avoid sodium, takes his medicine the same time every day, tries to avoid emotional stress, exercises, and gets adequate sleep. I did not make any medication changes today. When he returns in 6 months we will recheck the potassium, which, as I shared with him, was borderline elevated.
| anticipate he will need another echo in 1 year. He does drive a bus, and assuming no change in the requirements, based on the fact that he has been revascularized, does not have critically stenosis of the aortic valve, and is asymptomatic, with a normal blood pressure today, it would seem that he would be an acceptable candidate to continue to drive the bus.

There are no Patient Instructions on file for this visit.

RE: William L Chambers
D.O.B.: 12/12/1944
Dear Robert Nelson Jones M.D.
William L Chambers was seen in my office on 03/07/2019 for cardiovascular evaluation.
Cardiovascular History
William Chambers is a 74 year old male.
He is here today for a scheduled follow-up visit. In general he is feeling quite well. He is not having any pressure or heaviness or tightness or burning or squeezing in the chest nor is he having difficulty breathing or short of breath. Every now and then he will get a 'twinge' that lasts one second or less. It is unrelated to exercise. There is no lightheaded, dizzy, fainting, near fainting, palpitations, leg swelling.
He has been taking his medication. His 12-lead ECG today shows a normal sinus rhythm at 54 bpm with first-degree AV block without any significant change from October 18, 2017. His LDL cholesterol is much improved with ezetimibe. He has normal renal function. His glucose was mildly elevated. He was given a copy of his labs.
 Medication list reviewed.

This is a 74-year-old man with coronary disease and multivessel CABG in June 2017. He has PAD, and mild to moderate aortic stenosis. He also has high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Despite these comorbidities he is feeling well without any cardiovascular symptoms at this time. His blood pressure is above goal, and I have spent a long time today discussing options, and for now we will start with monitoring and lifestyle changes.
1. Continue statin, and ezetimibe for dyslipidemia. LDL at goal.
2. Continue aspirin for life if no contraindication. Monitor for bleeding.
3. Continue multiple medications for high blood pressure including the ACE inhibitor, amlodipine, and beta blocker.
4. Low-sodium DASH diet. 20 page handout provided. Blood pressure monitoring. Sheet provided.

Goals provided. He will drop of the blood pressure reading in one month for review, however, he does know to contact me for an earlier evaluation if the blood pressure remains elevated and if so he will make an appointment to discuss medicine changes which would likely result in increasing the amlodipine.
5. Otherwise 6 month follow-up echo to follow-up re: aortic stenosis.

Continue current cardiac medications.

- 'DASH' type diet, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes and nuts. Eat in moderation.
Favor fish over red meats. PLEASE REVIEW handout.
- Monitor and record your blood pressure at home. Bring the blood pressure record to you next office appointment; once in am and once in pm. It would be great if it were about 130/80 mmHg or so regularly.
Please drop off the readings after one month. Please contact me sooner if the blood pressures routinely
more than 140 mmHg on the top.
