Study Result
TECHNIQUE: Grayscale, color Doppler, and pulsed wave Doppler images of the bilateral carotid arteries were obtained.
COMPARIS
N: None.
FINDINGS:
Plaque is noted in the right carotid bulb extending into the ICA Both carotid systems demonstrate normal waveforms with brisk systolic upstrokes.
The velocities on the RIGHT (cm/s):
Right external carotid: 68
Right internal carotid: 60
Right common carotid: 114
Right ICA/CCA ratio: 0.5
Right vertebral artery: Patent with flow directed to the head.
The velocities on the LEFT (cm/s):
Left external carotid: 66
Left internal carotid: 51
Left common carotid: 119
Left ICA/CCA ratio: 0.4
Left vertebral Artery: Patent with flow directed to the head.
IMPRESSION:
1. [Less than 50%] stenosis right internal carotid artery.
2. [Less than 50%] stenosis left internal carotid artery.
3. [Bilateral vertebral artery flow directed toward the head in normal fashion.]
*Peak Systolic VelocityPercentage Stenosis
< 125 cm/seco - 49%
125 cm/sec - 250 cm/sec50 - 69%
250 cm/sec - 400 cm/sec70 - 90%
>400 cm/sec> 90%
Measurement of carotid stenosis is based on velocity parameters that correlate the residual internal carotid diameter with North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET)-based stenosis levels.
