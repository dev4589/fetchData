Reason For Visit
Reason for Visit: The patient is here for the evaluation of joint pain.
A consultation was requested by Drs. James Pope and Ali Torabzadeh....
HPI
Dear Drs. Pope and Torabzadeh, I have had the pleasure of seeing Ms. Wexler in consultation for the evaluation of joint pain. As you know, Ms.
Wexler is a 78 year old Caucasian woman who reported having pain in the left rib cage in July 2017. She stated that the pain would radiate from the side and radiate anteriorly. She described having pain in that location with coughing, yawning, sneezing, and with bending. The patient did not recall if the onset was sudden or gradual in July 2017. She did not recall any injury. The patient stated that she has a history of osteoporosis, and she did have a rib fracture on the right side in the past, but not on the left side. In October/November 2017, the right elbow would become painful. She reported being able to fully extend the right elbow. She reported that the pain would be present even with sitting. She stated that the symptoms would radiate to the rigth 4th and 5th fingers and lead to numbness of these fingers. She denied that she would lean on the right elbow. She reported having a herniated disc in the cervical spine but she stated that it did not hurt. She stated that she had a limitation with range of motion. However, she did not report shooting, electric pains into the arms.
The patient reported having osteoarthritis of the fingers. She reported having decreased function of the the thumbs at the 1st cmc joints. She stated that she did have surgery of the thumbs in 2016. The patient did not discuss the right elbow pain with her hand surgeon.
The patient reported taking gabapentin for another medical condition and she denied that the taking of gabapentin alleviated the right distal arm pain.
The patient reported having emphysema but she denied that the taking of prednisone would alleviate the rib pain.

Plan
 XR LT RIBS UNILATERAL 2 VIEWS - 71100; Requested for:26Feb2018;
Please CC results to (first/last name and town): : cxr December 2017
Signs and Symptoms : rib pain inferiorly, history of osteoporosis and copd
Discussion/Summary
Discussion / Summary:
It is my impression that the patient exhibited decreased range of motion of the cervical spine and that she had a scoliosis and osteoarthritis. She did not have notable tenderness in the left chest wall in February 2018. The question of a potential rib fracture secondary to osteoporosis would have been a consideration although she denied having an injury. The right distal arm pain appeared to be secondary to cubital tunnel syndrome with a positive tinel at the right elbow, and she would benefit from a reevaluation by her hand surgeon, Dr. Andrew
Caputo. The patient stated that she had lidocaine patches and other analgesics which she could apply to the left chest wall, and she declined any other analgesic.
The patient did have a cxr in December 2017 which did not reveal pulmonary disease, but there was no mention of the skeletal structures. I did request x-rays of the left ribs in February 2018 and I would be appreciative to review any other data from other treating physicians.
The patient and I spent the greater part of our visit in discussion of the presented medical problems, and I answered questions.
Thank you very much for asking me to see Ms. Wexler. I enjoyed meeting her.
Sincerely, Helena Nolasco MD
Time spent: 60 minutes of which greater than half the time was spent in counseling and discussion

SISTORY OF PRESENTES
She has done well since last visit. She is describing stable class 2 shortness of breath related to COPD. She does not have active exacerbation. She has not had chest pain. She had rib pain focally and by imaging was found to have rib fractures related to osteoporosis. She also has low back pain on this basis. She has no clinical signs of heart failure. CT imaging of the chest was performed as well demonstrating coronary calcification.

Discussion
Discussion Notes
Her breathing pattern has been stable following NYHA class 2 functional status. She has no chest pain and her EKG is normal.
On reviewing the mediastinal pictures from her recent CT scan there is evidence of coronary calcification. I think it would be in her best interest to at least 2 years of anti-lipid therapy trying to stabilize any plaque in her coronaries. Her last LDL was 148 with an outstanding HDL of 77. Discussed the benefits of low-dose statin therapy which is a 50% reduction in heart attack and stroke rates and the 4% risk of myalgia and 0.01% risk of reversible hepatic transaminitis. She has agreed to proceed with atorvastatin 10 mg q.p.m..
Three-month follow-up laboratories were given.
Her clinical exam is completely normal. We have not surveyed for pulmonary hypertension in some time. I do not feel strongly about doing unless it will change the treatment plan from Dr. Pope.
She has no recurrent tachycardia episodes.

PHYSICAL FINDINGS (S CATEGORY):
Finding: Moderate emphysema
Significance category: Variable clinical significance.
