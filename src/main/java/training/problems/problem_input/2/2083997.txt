D&C for 6 hip surgeries in the past 8 years. She uses a cane and is slow to get out of the chair.
Currently she reports her mood is 'good' and also 'wonderful.' Does endorse periods of depressed mood that occur on the magnitude of a couple hours at a time but never lasting days or weeks. Habitually has slept from 10 to 2am and then 5 to 8:30 am. Gets 7.5 hours and also usually has an hour's nap in the afternoon - this has been her sleep schedule for years including back when she was working. Not fatigued and this sleep schedule does not affect her functioning. Enjoys going to the senior dinners but notes many of her friends have died. Really enjoyed talking to Tina and is looking forward to working with her.

She reported her chief stressor is her husband. He still works and also spends a lot of time helping a friend who had a stroke. She feels he helps the friend more than he cares for her. Other stressor is their granddaughter who they evicted last August after she was found stealing from them to support her heroin addiction. She reports she still feels sad about this.
Of note - the patient was very tangential during the interview despite frequent re- direction. When asked about how she did in school she reported she gots Bs, Cs, and Ds. She reports she struggled due to being 'hyper.'
Safety: no lifetime history of attempts. No access to gun. Some Sl years ago but
'I could never do that.' Reports she sees a future where she will be more active. Cites her religious beliefs as a strong and major protective factor - believes many angels are watching over her.
Substance Use Hx: denies tobacco, mj, or drug use. No alcohol 'in years.'
Psych ROS: denies lifetime history of hypomania/mania and of all psychotic sx.
No hlo OCD, GAD, PTSD. No history of trauma.
Medication Management Care Plan:
Long term goal: Medication adherence and compliance with behavioral health appointments. Short term goal
: Pt will verbalize an understanding of medications ordered, including rationale, food and drug interactions, side effects, schedule for taking and importance of taking as prescribed. Objectives: Take medications as prescribed and report effectiveness and /or side effects at each medication visit as evidence by timeliness of refills and lab results if applicable. Attend scheduled medication appointments. Interventions: Medication management and education at each visit.
Examination
Mental Status:
Patient appears younger than her stated age. She is wearing a white shirt, gray pants, black shoes. She gets up slowly from the chair and uses a cane to guide herself while ambulating. Calm and cooperative. Fair eye contact. No tics/tremors/PMA/PMR
Speech normal. Mood 'good.' Affect congruent, euthymic, full, not labile. Thought process tangential despite frequent redirection. Denies SI/H/AHVHPI. No signs of psychosis. Alert and oriented to person place time and situation. Cognition intact conversational testing. Insight fair. Judgment good-attending appointment, taking medication, reporting symptoms.
Assessments
1. Depressive disorder, not elsewhere classified - F32.9 (Primary)

'Kathy' is a 76 yo Caucasian, married for 52 years, mother of adult male 50 and female
51, grandmother, currently living at their family farm with her husband, cat, 2 guinea pigs, multitude of rabbits, who is retired and who never before has seen a psychiatrist who is here today at the referral of her PCP. She was urged to start psychotherapy and she has met with our Tina Silver already for intake into psychotherapy with Ms. Silver.
Safety: no lifetime history of attempts. No access to gun. Some Sl years ago but 'I could never do that.' Reports she sees a future where she will be more active. Cites her religious beliefs as a strong and major protective factor - believes many angels are watching over her.
Diagnostically, her depression is very light and doesn't inhibit her function in anyway.
She does not meet criteria for MDD. Given her tangentiality, it seems she may have
ADHD - and did report she struggled in school and was 'hyper' back then. She also reports a horse accident with loss of consciousness and notes her memory was affected. Yet, none of these problems affect her function. Patient is not currently interested in starting a psychotropic and this is reasonable. She reports she will call if she changes her mind.
The patient was given a copy of this writer's business card and was encouraged to call if she'd like to start a medicine. We also reviewed the safety plan - she is to call 911 and go straight to the ED if having any thoughts of suicide. She agreed with these plans.
A copy of this note will be faxed to the patient's PCP for continuity of care.

RE: Katherine Z Miller
D.O.B.: 07/13/1942
Dear Elizabeth A. Stankiewicz A.P.R.N.
Katherine Z Miller was seen in my office on 02/18/2016 for cardiovascular evaluation.
Cardiovascular History
Katherine Miller is a 73 year old female.
It was a pleasure meeting Katherine for cardiovascular evaluation.
She is a pleasant 73-year-old female who is here with her husband for preop visit. She is anticipating total left shoulder replacement.
She has had multiple problems with osteoarthritis and had already both hip replaced. Now she has significant limitation in movement of the left shoulder as well as pain. She cannot raise her arm above her shoulders. She is scheduled for total shoulder replacement in early March.
She has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, family history of CAD and impaired fasting glucose. She takes HCTZ for hypertension but declines treatment for her hyperlipidemia.
She walks about 20 minutes daily without significant chest pain or shortness of breath. However she feels that her shoulder pain is exacerbated if she is active. She can go a flight of stairs and feels slightly short of breath. She use to experience more shortness of breath when she was heavier. She denies any orthopnea or PND.
She reports mild palpitations at times.
She takes antibiotics prior to dental procedure for MVP. Ilowever her echocardiogram in 2009 did not show any evidence of MVP.
0
Medication list reviewed.
Not feeling tired (fatigue).
No total loss of vision.

Clinical summary provided to patient.
.
 Education and counseling: Given for current problems
In summary Mrs. Miller is a 73-year-old female with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, impaired fasting glucose and family history of coronary artery disease. She is anticipating total shoulder replacement.
She has difficulty with ambulation because of her osteoarthritis in the hips as well as shoulder pain. She reports left shoulder pain which is likely related to her osteoarthritis although it does get exacerbated with exertion. She has mild dyspnea and exertion. Her EKG does not show any acute EKG changes.
It is somewhat difficult to evaluate her exertional capacity considering her limitation in activity.
Prior to surgery I would recommend stress test. Patient is agreeable and stress test will be done next week.
Her blood pressure is reasonably well controlled and I would continue with hydrochlorothiazide.
He should also has history of hyperlipidemia but declines treatment.
If the stress test is normal patient should be able to proceed with her shoulder replacement with low cardiovascular risk.
