Hospital Course
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of lumbar stenosis at L3-L4, L4-L5, lateral listhesis
L4-5, lumbar scoliosis, lumbar spondylolisthesis. She had been evaluated in the office by Dr. Hicks.
She had failed conservative treatment and management. After the risks and benefits of surgery were discussed with the patient, she agreed to proceed with surgical intervention. She presented to
Middlesex Hospital on July 15, 2019 for an elective lumbar interbody fusion, L3-L4, L4-L5, performed by Dr. Hicks. She tolerated the procedure well and no complications were noted. She received 24 hours of perioperative prophylactic antibiotics of Ancef. IV and oral pain medications were ordered for pain control. Her diet was advanced as tolerated with return of bowel function.
She worked with physical therapy as she is weightbearing as tolerated with spine precautions.
Once she had adequate pain control with oral medications, was spontaneously voiding, tolerating a regular diet, and cleared from a medical and orthopedic perspective, discharge planning was initiated. She was ready for discharge to home with family support on postoperative day 2.
Discharge Recommendations
- Incision : Keep incision clean and dry. If no drainage, may leave incision open to air. Otherwise apply a dry dressing once daily as needed.
- Activity : Weightbearing as tolerated with spine precautions. No bending, twisting or lifting.
- DVT prophylaxis : Encourage ambulation
- Pain control : Continue with medications as ordered. Hold for oversedation. Titrate down as able.

Contact the office for refills. No refills over the weekend.
- No aspirin or anticoagulants for 10 days from surgery. No NSAIDs for 3 months. Contact Dr. Hicks' office before resuming.
- Encourage incentive spirometry.

Reason for Appointment
1. S/P LUMBAR SURGERY
History of Present Illness
General HPI:
Sharon presents today for a hospital follow-up. Briefly she is a 75 year old female status post lumbar surgery by Dr. Hicks. She was admitted to Middlesex Hospital from 7/15 through 7/17. She had lumbar stenosis around L3/L4 as well as L4/L5 and went through lumbar fusion. Today she states she's doing well. She denies any fevers, chills, abdominal pain, urinary symptoms, or concerns of infection around the incision site. She denies any known redness, heat, swelling, or discharge from the area. Pain level currently3-5/10 depending on the time day. Pain worse as day goes on. She is using tylenol only. She did see Dr. Hick for a follow up who was happy with progress. She has had some swelling in her right foot and he ordered and US. No calf involvement. No redness, heat, or other findings. Has another FU with him in 2 weeks. She does have a dry cough at times and would like some tesselon to help. No fevers, chills, SOB, or other congestion. This is believed to be related to maybe some mild irritation from the endotracheal tube. Of note, she was admitted earlier in the month for an electrolyte distubrance and we will recheck that today as well. She states she's feeling well and has had no confusion, nausea, significant fatigue, or other concerns.

Laboratory Studies : Electrocardiogram :
A 12-lead ECG was performed 10-16-15 showing sinus rhythm, heart rate 53, early RS transition.
Continuous ECG Monitoring:
Continuous ECG monitoring by 24-hour Holter monitor was performed 8-21-12. Sinus rhythm with low-grade atrial and ventricular ectopic activity. No pauses. There were dynamic ST-T wave changes in the superior leads of questionable significance. 4 episodes of palpitations were associated with a single isolated ventricular premature beat.
Cardiovascular Stress Test:
A cardiac stress test was performed 8-21-12. Limited exercise capacity. Clinically negative for anginal symptoms. Electrocardiographically negative for ischemic changes. Mrs. Swittlinger's heart rate was elevated at rest and she reached 100% of THR within 6 mins. She did hold her morning dose of atenolol, and she did report palpitations which corresponded to the occasional PVCs noted during exercise.
Imaging:
Echocardiogram:
An echocardiogram was performed 4-25-14. Normal left ventricular size and function. Mild mitral regurgitation. Mild tricuspid regurgitation. MH.
Cardiac Isotope Imaging:
Myocardial perfusion study conclusions 4-10-14. Stress test is negative for chest pain or ischemic
EKG changes. Medium-sized fixed anterior defect of moderate intensity consistent with soft tissue attenuation. No ischemia. Left ventricle is normal in size and function. Ejection fraction 74%. No wall motion abnormalities.

Sharon J Swittlinger 08/21/1943
She is happy to report that she is generally feeling well. She has no ongoing cardiovascular complaints, except occasional palpitations that are improved. These are likely due to PVCs as noted previously. There is no heart failure. There is no angina. Her blood pressure was elevated here. She was surprised by this.
She has not been checking her blood pressure regularly. We discussed different options including medication changes, particularly since there is borderline hyponatremia with hydrochlorothiazide. At this point, however she is now willing to do so because of the pending trip to Thailand. She is also wondering if her blood pressure is elevated because she is here in the physician's office. With this in mind she will start to track her blood pressure. She will write down the readings, and contact me if it is quite high. If not, she will make an appointment for follow up when she returns from Thailand to discuss potential medication changes. Longitudinally, she would benefit from weight loss as well. If there has never been an evaluation for sleep apnea, that could be considered as well.
- Pt expressed understanding and willingness to follow the care plan.
- Monitor and record your blood pressure at home. Bring the blood pressure record to you next office appointment. Also bring the blood pressure cuffin. Make an appointment to be seen when you return from Thailand.
- Change your diet to a low carbohydrate, low saturated fat diet (< 7% of calorie intake), such as a
'Mediterranean' type or 'DASH' type diet, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes and nuts.
Eat in moderation. Favor fish over red meats.
Thank you for allowing me to evaluate Sharon J Swittlinger. If you have any questions, please feel free to call me.
Sincerely, Joseph P. Longhitano M.D.
