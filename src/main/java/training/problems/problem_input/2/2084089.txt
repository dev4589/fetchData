She is completely bed and bed to chair due to past CVA. Leaving the facility is very taxing physically and emotionally. CC: Patient was seen for tcm visit. I had discussed her visit with the daughter on the phone. There was some confusion with the med list as the hospital switched her back to eliquis_ -there is no rationale for this after search done and it seems it was a copy of the med from her last visit -back in sept she had been switched to xarelto -we have now clarified that she should go off eliquis and back to xarelto for the reason of cost as noted in sept and this has now been communicated to the facility and pharmay. Geri psych services will not be in the building for 2 weeks ___patient is more confused -getting out of bed -hospital did not have any significant findings except copd exaserbation they gave her a neb and pred -she is improving, but still is congested and this is several days later so I am going to start an antibiotic, esp related to the worsening confusion and frequent falls. She is telling me that she is not falling out of bed several times recently -she is sliding out because she can't sleep -I gave her remeron and it is not working -she is delusional and thinks her parents are alive -there are no other acute medical changes or neuro focality. There are no fcs no cough no cp and no sob -wbc were elevated when she first went into the hospital. I am going to repeat her labs, added an antibiotic, and adjusted her meds -stop zyrtec and remeron, increase seroquel -she has refused two home care agencies -I will ask the daughter to touch base with them and try to be there when they come in. She did not concurrently take xarelto with the eliquis and I have changed this back to xarelto in her med list here and notified the facility after investigation.| ||encounter for fracture with routine healing|Vital Signs|

Hospital Course
Admission History of Present Illness 1/12

-------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------
Patient is an 85 y/o F with PMH AFib, recurrent falls, h/o CVA with left hemiparesis who presents being sent in from PCP office for abnormal labs and concern for needing placement. | reviewed old records. Patient does have a h/o dementia but is alert and oriented and appropriate at this time. She was recently admitted 12/31 --> 1/3 with worsening anemia and heme + stool. During that admit, PT recommended STR but patient's family wanted her to return to Village at South Farms with 24-hr care. I s/w family today who said they are now willing for her to go to STR. The patient tells me she has been mainly w/c dependent since returning to the village at south farms. She c/o generalized weakness and fatigue. She reports feeling 'cold all the time' No chest pain or SOB. No fevers/chills. No bowel/bladder changes.
Yesterday she was seen by PCP and labs revealed TSH of 66 so she was sent to ED for evaluation and documentation from ED reports PCP feels patient should be placed in SNF.
Patient has had several admits and ED visits. In December she had ED visit and noted to have
TSH 16 with normal T4. Amiodarone was discontinued at that time, no thyroid replacement was ordered.
I reviewed ED record. Notable for dehydration and TSH 66. She was admitted for further management
Hospital Course
Hypothyroidism- may be due to effects of amiodarone. Amiodarone was discontinued in December when here TSH was noted to be 16; however effects can last for months. I did d/w endocrine via telephone 1/12---> suspect still related to amiodarone. They recommend starting low dose synthroid given her age/comorbid conditions --> started levothyroxine 50mcg. Endocrine recommends repeat TFTs in 2-4 weeks and if T4 remains low, to gradually increase her synthroid.
Dementia- with behavioral disturbance- on 1/12 1 d/w daughter who reports patient has periods of agitation which has worsened over the past few months. Patient did have increasing agitation on 1/13 likely due to some delirium with recurrent hospitalizations, new environment, etc.
Unfortunately, she did require a 1x dose of IM haldol. She has not received haldol since 1pm on 1/13. Psychiatry input was obtained and appreciated. Patient will remain on seroquel
50mg at bedtime and remeron 15mg at bedtime. We will add AM dose of seroquel- she did receive 50mg this AM and it does appear this is too sedating so we wil decrease to Seroquel
25mg in the AM which can be further titrated at the SNF as appropriate. Additionally, would recommend seroquel 25mg q 6 h as needed for agitation. Patient had QTC in December which was prolonged, however repeat EKG this AM shows QTc is okay at 486.
Dehydration- clinically improved and taking good PO:
Mild AKI- likely due to vol depletion- resolved with IVF.
Gen weakness- likely due to recurrent admits. Patient has been evaluated by PT who felt appropriate for STR. Patient will need continued skilled therapy to see if she can return to her baseline level of functioning.
AFib- chronic- rate controlled. She is continued on metoprolol. Xarelto was reduced on this admit to 15mg per pharmacy given renal insufficiency
Recent UGIB with gastric erosions: No evidence of bleeding. H/H has been low/stable. She is iron deficient and will need FeSO4 BID.
Anemia- stable, iron deficiency: FeSO4 BID was started this admit. B12/folate were checked and okay.

Addendum by GARCIA JOSHUA D on January 14, 2019 22:42 (Verified)
I have interviewed and examined the patient myself. I was present for all key aspects of the service and participated in the management of the patient. I have read and agree with the Resident's note unless noted otherwise in my documentation.
Additional Comments:
Patient seen and examined at bedside in the AM. Patient is more cooperative, but slightly sedated after
AM seroquel. Will decrease AM dose to 25mg. Appreciate psychiatry consult. Patient is stable for D/C to
SNF. Repeat EKG revealed improved qTC.

At that point , we made the referral to Franciscian Home Care again and Jeff at intake saiid they would pick up . She is also getting a live in now , and doing well during most of day_ _ - eating and drinking well and they don't report any new weakness , but her behaviors including yelling out an agitation at night still a concern_ _ - recently she had not been sleeping and her was steadily being increased . I have asked that psych see her and they will be here at the end of the week . Given her behaviors further increase her seroquel and the order is written at the .

6. Oxygen desaturation - Ro9.02 oxgen low than baseline, but she is not in distress----I am ordering a cxr at the facility--- I will reorder the labs from the 20th and additional ones due to her behavior (althought it is not much different than it has been). It is possible that the 20th labs were not done as she was back out at the hospital and the holiday schedule. I have had a long conversations with her daughter and son and the facility----we are hoping she will sleep more with the increased seroquel, but I will try to r/o other issues with the cxr and labs---there is no evidence of urinary tract infection as they deny pain, freq, foul urine, or fever. Psych will see on the 11th, and I will try to speak to the psych nurse on treatment plan.

History of Present Illness
General HPI:
Reason for Domicilliary Visit: Patient was seen at her assisted living at the request of her pcp and daughter. She is completely bed and bed to chair due to past CVA. Leaving the facility is very taxing physically and emotionally.
CC: Patient was seen for ED follow up. She had routine labs that did not publish for 4 days later, and they were abnormal----I was away and Dr Levine repeated them and they were worse and patient was sent to ED---she was evaluated there and they believed she was experiencing toxicity from amiodorone which cardiology started for rapid a fib in august----she had been in the hospital in nov and there was no problem noted with her ekg, but it seems that she has rapidly gotten toxic from it based on lfts and renal function----cardiology recommended to stop it, and she is supposed to follow up with them--- will have to see if they plan to bring her (family)---in the meantime they recommennded increasing her metoprolol. Nursing was not present when I went there and I will discuss her condition with them by phone tomorrow. She is also supposed to follow up with psych. Her vss today and she is not having any increased resp distress.
